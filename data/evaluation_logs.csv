2026-01-31T10:27:14.359805,how spatial transcriptomics data could distinguish between microglial activation states driven by local Aβ burden versus systemic immune signaling?,"Spatial transcriptomics data could potentially distinguish between microglial activation states driven by local Aβ burden versus systemic immune signaling by analyzing gene expression patterns in specific brain regions [3]. This approach allows for the examination of how microglia respond to Aβ plaques in their immediate vicinity versus how they respond to signals originating from the peripheral immune system [1, 4].

Here's how spatial transcriptomics could differentiate these activation states:

1.  **Identifying Region-Specific Gene Expression:** Spatial transcriptomics can reveal unique gene expression signatures of microglia located near Aβ plaques compared to microglia in regions with less Aβ burden [3]. For example, microglia directly interacting with Aβ may show increased expression of genes related to phagocytosis, inflammasome activation (e.g., NLRP3), and Aβ clearance [1].

2.  **Distinguishing Systemic Inflammatory Signatures:** Microglia responding to systemic immune signals might exhibit a different gene expression profile, potentially involving the upregulation of genes associated with general immune response pathways like interferon signaling or cytokine production [5]. Comparing these gene signatures with those of microglia near Aβ plaques can help differentiate between local and systemic influences.

3.  **Analyzing Spatial Relationships:** Spatial analysis can identify correlations between microglial activation states and the proximity to Aβ plaques, blood vessels (as entry points for systemic immune factors), or other cell types (e.g., astrocytes, neurons) [3, 4]. This can help determine whether microglial activation is primarily driven by local Aβ or influenced by broader inflammatory signals.

4.  **Pathway Enrichment Analysis:** Analyzing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in microglia using pathway enrichment analysis can reveal which pathways are activated in response to Aβ versus systemic signals [3]. For instance, Aβ-driven activation might show enrichment for pathways related to Aβ processing and clearance, while systemic immune signaling might show enrichment for general inflammatory pathways [1, 5].

By combining spatial transcriptomics with other techniques like spatial proteogenomics, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying microglial activation in AD [3]. This can lead to the identification of specific targets for therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating microglial activity and reducing neuroinflammation [4, 5].",8,how spatial transcriptomics data could distinguish between microglial activation states driven by local Aβ burden versus systemic immune signaling?,"[""Microglia  are  yolk-sac  derived  myeloid  cells  that  carry  out  many critical  functions  in  the  brain  from  maintaining  homeostasis,  modulating  neuronal  activity  and  importantly,  mediating  the  immune response  of  the  central  nervous  system  (CNS).  These  cells  are  the guardians  of  the  brain.  Microglia  are  highly  phagocytic  and  by expressing an array of PRRs to detect PAMPs or DAMPs, along with constantly  surveying  their  microenvironment,  they  are  poised  to respond to any threat or injury they encounter. However, unlike other tissues and organs, the brain is very sensitive to inflammation. Therefore, the microglial inflammatory response must be carefully regulated to limit the damage to neighbouring neurons and later support remodelling or repair. There are also number of receptor-ligand interactions\n\nR.M. McManus and E. Latz between microglia and astrocytes or neurons to maintain the microglia in a regulated state (Manich et al., 2019; Finneran and Nash, 2019). This is a very delicate balance, and the microglial response easily becomes disordered in diseases of the brain.\n\nWhen Alois Alzheimer first described Alzheimer ' s disease in 1907, he already  noted  the  presence  of  abnormal  glial  cells  neighbouring  the amyloid plaques (Alzheimer et al., 1995). We now know that microglia have a key role in the progression and development of AD. Genome-wide association  studies  (GWAS)  have  identified  many  microglial-specific genes that increase the risk for developing AD, such as Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), CD33 and complement receptor 1 (CR1) (Naj et al., 2011; Bellenguez et al., 2022), many of which affect microglial phagocytosis (Butler et al., 2021; Ulrich et al., 2014). In 2008, Halle and colleagues first showed that when microglia phagocytose A β it triggers activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Halle et  al.,  2008),  thus  firmly  establishing the  role of innate immune signalling in this neurodegenerative disease."", 'Human MSigDB . Gene lists were analyzed using the enrichR package 57 with the hallmark gene-set collection from the Human MSigDB. For lists containing specifically downregulated genes, combined scores were negated. A significance threshold was set at a BenjaminiHochberg-adjusted P value of 0.05.\n\nMicroglia states . Signed probability fold change was calculated for each gene as the product of the negative logarithm of the adjusted P value and the log 2 fold change. Enrichment for human microglial activation states 34,41 was assessed using the fgsea package, with probability fold change as the ranking metric. Custom gene sets associated with various microglial activation states were compiled from the supplementary materials provided in the referenced studies. Normalized enrichment scores were calculated, and significance was determined through permutation testing, with P values adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. A threshold of 0.05 was applied for adjusted P values, with no specific cutoff for the magnitude of NES values.', 'a , Lecanemab binds oligomeric and protofibrillar Aβ to promote Aβ clearance from the brain.

Using separate microglial classifications 34 showed a reduction in stress-responsive microglia (Mic.11), surveilling microglia (Mic.2, Mic.4), reactive microglia (Mic.6-Mic.8), interferon-responsive microglia (Mic.14) and serpin family E member 1 ( SERPINE1 )-expressing microglia (Mic.16) after immunization (Fig. 2q).\n\nOverall, active Aβ immunization reduces stress-responsive microglia irrespective of residual Aβ levels. Yet, microglia in iAD-ext shifted from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, while iAD-lim showed decreased complement and unfolded protein responses with upregulated phagocytosis genes. These findings suggest that effective Aβ clearance relies on balanced microglial metabolic states that also protect against Aβ neurotoxicity.', 'Inflammation is a response produced towards any injury, trauma or infection to the cells and tissues. It is believed that brain and immune system has a biochemical link. Inflammation that occurs in the brain is known as neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation is sometimes beneficial and sometimes destructing to the neuronal cells as over-activation of the inflammatory molecules can cause damage to the cells of the brain (Fig.\xa02) (Shabab et\xa0al. 2017). Neuroinflammation leads to activation of inflammatory cells in the brain including microglia and astrocytes. The brain is regarded as an ""immunological privileged organ"" because peripheral immune cells are expected not to enter the blood-brain barrier. Rather, glial cells-microglia and astrocytes, are the primary component of the committed neuroimmune system, and interrelate with peripheral immunity but not clearly justified. The glial cells provide favorable and anti-inflammatory actions under normal and pathological conditions, counting phagocytosis, steroid release, free radical depletion, and repairing of cells. Release of cytokines and generation of free radicals can cause neuronal cell death and synaptic dysfunction. So if there is imbalance between the regulations of proinflammatory anti-inflammatory function, it can cause brain injury (Schain and Kreisl 2017).\n\nMicroglia and astrocytes are the two main constituents of the immune system of brain and they have a key function in the neuroinflammation process. In normal conditions microglia have a phagocytic action which removes\n\nFig. 2 Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer\'s disease. Figure\xa02 shows the hyperactive glial cells including astrocytes and microglia upon interaction between Aβ and tau. Microglia and astrocytes are the major cells in the brain responsible for inflammatory responses. Due to the activation of glial cells various pro-inflammatory mediators are released which direct more inflammatory molecules at the site of injury leading to exaggerated inflammatory response in brain called neuroinflammation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndamaged neurons thus encourages the repair of tissue at the site of invasion by foreign molecules or pathogens where the immune functions of the cells are initiated. Astrocytes remove the debris from the cerebrospinal fluid and play a neuroprotective role. In Alzheimer\'s disease there is accretion of these cells around the NFTs and senile plaques. In activated state these cells release cytokines, interleukins and chemokines which act as pro-inflammatory components and potentiate the neuroinflammatory process in the brain contributing to AD (Walters et\xa0al. 2016).\n\nApoE is the risk element for Alzheimer disease that possesses immunomodulatory action. This capacity of ApoE is conjugated with triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which is mediated by microglia in the CNS (Shi et\xa0al. 2018). Elevated levels of cytokines in the brain are closely linked with AD. The interleukins and TNF α along with Cox-2 are the major cytokines considered to be involved. Cytokines generation in the brain mediated by Aβ also promotes microglia mediated free radical generation. In general IL-1 is involved in the progression of AD which is released from neurons, astrocytes and microglia. IL-1 enhances the abnormal processing of APP and generates Aβ. There is an increased concentration of IL-1 in the brain of AD patients. Aβ is generally considered to increase the interleukin levels. In contrast, it is seen that interleukins are responsible to generate Aβ from neurons and astrocytes. IL-1 also induces the release of other cytokines and increase NOS activity which results in toxicity of neurons (Sawikr et\xa0al. 2017).', 'There is an intricate link between the immune system and CNS; when this balance is broken, it can cause neuroinflammation  and,  ultimately,  AD.  Neuroinflammation  is an inflammatory response in the CNS caused by various pathological injuries. In this process, CNS glial cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, produce various pro-inflammatory  cytokines,  such  as  Interleukin-1β  (IL-1β),  IL-6, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and chemokines, as well  as  small  molecule  messengers  and  reactive  oxygen species [31]. CNS glial cells thus play an important role in the progression of inflammation.\n\nStem  cell  technology  allows  researchers  to  study  the interplay between immune function and AD using models like co-culture of immune cells from a single patient with  their  organoids  [82].  As  stem  cell-derived  3D  cultures  can  generate  human  oligodendrocyte  spheroids, astrocyte  spheroids,  and  neurons,  these  models  can  be applied to investigate glial cell functional abnormalities, different glial cell interactions, neuronal interaction networks,  and  the  mechanisms  of  AD  immune  disorders. Bianco et\xa0al. [10] used a microfluidic platform to investigate  the  complex  roles  of  different  regional  astrocytes in  neuroinflammation.  They  inoculated  astrocytes  from the  cortex  and  hippocampus,  as  well  as  primary  hippocampal neuron cell types, from rat embryos in different chambers of the microfluidic network. By examining the effects on neuronal viability in two neuroinflammatory  injury  models  (i.e.,  metabolic  stress  and  exposure to  amyloid  β  protofibrils),  they  clarified  the  differential contributions  of  brain  region-specific  neuroglia  in  two in\xa0 vitro  models.  This  study  reflects  the  superiority  of 3D microfluidic  organ  chips  with  multiple  chambers  to independently control culture conditions and selectively differentiate stem cells into different cell types with different stimuli. As this is also an open-ended method, it allows  close  monitoring  of  the  specific  contribution  of each cell type by analyzing morphology, viability, calcium kinetic, and electrophysiological parameters when different chambers are micro fluidically connected [10]. Such models can reveal the complexity of cell-cell interactions in  neuroinflammation, which is of great importance for elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved. To study the  effect  of  the  immune  system  on  neuronal  signaling, Guttikonda et\xa0al. [44] established a well-defined human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC)-derived tri-culture system containing pure populations of hPSC-derived microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. Using this culture system, they were able to demonstrate that increased complement C3 production in the brain is partly\xa0caused by microglia activation and its\xa0interaction with astrocytes, which in turn worsens neuroinflammation [44].\n\nSynthetic  models  with  AD  features  have  also  been developed. For example, Park et\xa0al. [95] used this technique  to  create  a  human  ternary  culture  model  containing  NPC-derived  neurons  and  astrocytes  as  well  as immortalized  human  microglia.  This  method  reflected the  phenomena  of  microglia  recruitment,  neurotoxic activity,  and  nitrogen  monoxide (NO) release damaging AD  neurons  and  astrocytes  and  is  suitable  for  further investigating the complex molecular mechanisms of neuroinflammation that underlie AD pathology [95]. Human pluripotent stem cell-derived brain-like Organoids\n\nco-cultured with immune cells from AD patients can also be used to better understand inter-glial interactions and provide  an  ideal  experimental  platform  to  explore  the mechanisms of AD immune dysfunction under an in\xa0vivo growth environment.\n\nAs a proof of concept, we can use patient-derived stem cell platforms to study the role of the immune system and various glial cell communication disorders in the development of AD. This represents a paradigm shift in understanding  the  role  of  immunity  in  human  disease  and opens new avenues for AD research and treatment. In the future, new models could be developed to evaluate novel therapeutical interventions for AD such as immunomodulatory therapy, anti-inflammatory drugs, and immunoglobulin therapy.\n\nIn  summary,  reprogramming  somatic  cells  from  AD patients  back  to  stem  cells  that  can  be  re-differentiated into in\xa0vitro disease models to probe disease progression and  pathogenesis  provides  a  new  approach  for  understanding  the  pathogenesis  of  human  neurodegenerative  diseases.  This  approach  also  takes  advantage  of  the reverse engineering platform to monitor and determine key  pathogenetic  events  during  disease  development. The hallmark of degeneration of the aging brain is selective  cell  vulnerability  in  disease-specific  patterns  many decades after the birth of long-lived brain cells. The traditional  paradigm  for  investigating  neurodegeneration has  been  to  define  the  biological  processes  and  pathways mediating brain cell dysfunction and death during the adult life; neurodegenerative diseases have thus been considered  a  discrete  pathological  entity  rather  than  a continuum  of  a  common  pathogenic  process.  The  new perspective  considers  neurodegenerative  diseases  as  a fundamental  disorder  of  neural  development  in  which subtle impairment in the regional programming of neural  development  results  in  selective  neural  and  brain network vulnerability to a spectrum of late-life stressors. Indeed, emerging data support the possibility of pathogenic associations between abnormalities in the birth and death of vulnerable brain cell subtypes [210].', 'Community 0: Contains concepts [""Alzheimer\'s disease"", \'heightened immune response\']...', 'Community 3: Contains concepts [\'Nrf2\', \'NF-kB\', ""Alzheimer\'s Disease"", \'JAK/STAT\', \'Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway\']...', ""Community 5: Contains concepts ['GSK3β signaling', 'pathophysiology of AD']...""]","Spatial transcriptomics data could potentially distinguish between microglial activation states driven by local Aβ burden versus systemic immune signaling by analyzing gene expression patterns in specific brain regions [3].

2026-01-31T10:35:37.365273,how spatial transcriptomics data could distinguish between microglial activation states driven by local Aβ burden versus systemic immune signaling?,"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) data can distinguish between microglial activation states driven by local Aβ burden versus systemic immune signaling by analyzing gene expression patterns in specific spatial locations within the brain [2]. Here's how:

*   **Aβ Niche Analysis:** ST allows for the identification of Aβ-rich spots in the gray matter and the clustering of these spots based on gene expression [1]. Differential gene expression analysis of these Aβ-rich spots can reveal distinct microglial responses in different conditions [1]. For example, the ""cortical Aβ-6 cluster"" was enriched in microglia and prominent in lecanemab-treated samples [1].

*   **Microglial Subtype Mapping:** ST can map previously identified microglial subtypes to Aβ-rich spots [1]. This reveals the enrichment of specific microglial subtypes (e.g., Mg-2 and Mg-4) in Aβ niches in treated brain areas [1, 4]. Further gene expression analysis of these subtype-specific ST spots can identify unique gene expression signatures associated with each treatment [1].

*   **Differential Gene Expression:** By comparing gene expression in Aβ-associated microglia between different treatment groups (e.g., AN1792 vs. nAD, lecanemab vs. nAD), ST can identify upregulated genes specific to each condition [1]. For example, *FAM107A* was uniquely increased in Mg-2 and Mg-4 Aβ-associated ST spots in AN1792 samples, while *SPP1* and *LIPA* were associated only with lecanemab treatment [1]. *APOE* and *TREM2* were common responsive genes in both treatments [1].

*   **High-Definition ST:** High-definition ST can provide single-cell resolution, allowing for the mapping of nuclei to Aβ plaques using immunofluorescence staining [1]. Differential expression analysis can then confirm increased expression of specific genes (e.g., *SPP1*, *APOE*) in microglia near Aβ plaques after specific treatments [1].

*   **Cell-Cell Signaling:** ST data can be used to map cell-to-cell signaling pathways related to *APOE*, complement, and *SPP1*, revealing increased microglial signaling via complement and *SPP1* pathways in lecanemab-treated brains and elevated *APOE* signaling in both lecanemab and AN1792 samples [1].

*   **Regional Variability:** ST can reveal regional variability in microglial transcriptomic signatures [3]. For example, most changes in microglial gene expression in the lecanemab case were observed in the TCX and PCX, the two regions with the most Aβ clearance [3].

By analyzing these spatial gene expression patterns, researchers can distinguish between microglial activation states driven by local Aβ burden (reflected in the expression of genes related to Aβ processing and clearance) and those driven by systemic immune signaling (reflected in the expression of genes related to inflammation and immune response) [1, 3].",8,how spatial transcriptomics data could distinguish between microglial activation states driven by local Aβ burden versus systemic immune signaling?,"['To identify common and distinct microglial responses to Aβ after active and passive immunization, we integrated analyses of all tissues. We quantified Aβ coverage in the gray matter, confirming a decrease in coverage associated with immunization (Fig. 5a, b). Additionally, we observed increased myeloid recruitment to Aβ (Fig. 5c). To examine cellular responses to Aβ, we integrated and clustered cortical gray matter Aβ-rich ST spots (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). This yielded nine distinct Aβ niche clusters based on gene expression (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 5c). We hypothesized that these differences were driven by distinct cellular microenvironments and tested this by using C2L to predict cell-type abundances from our integrated scRNA-seq atlas (Extended Data Fig. 5d). The cortical Aβ-6 cluster, enriched in microglia, was most prominent in the lecanemab sample, followed by a lesser increase in AN1792 samples (Fig. 5f). This cluster was defined by expression of A2M , APOE , C1QC , C3 , SPP1 and others (Extended Data Fig. 5e). Thus, the cortical Aβ-6 cluster likely represents Aβ-rich ST spots with recruited myeloid cells. In AN1792 samples with limited Aβ clearance and in lecanemab-treated brain regions, this cluster showed higher microglia abundance of Mg-2 and Mg-4 compared to nAD controls (Extended Data Fig. 5f).\n\nDifferential expression analysis of Aβ-6 ST spots between AN1792 and nAD samples identified upregulation of FAM107A , RAB13 , TREM2 and others in AN1792 samples (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 5g). In lecanemab-treated ST spots, we observed upregulation of A2M , APOE and others (Fig. 5h and Extended Data Fig. 5g). SPP1 lacked zero counts, making the MAST hurdle model unsuitable. Using DESeq2, we revealed that SPP1 was highly upregulated in lecanemab-treated cortical Aβ-6 ST spots (Fig. 5i). We plotted previously identified microglial subtypes in Aβ-rich ST spots, finding enrichment of Mg-2 and Mg-4 microglia subtypes in Aβ niches of lecanemab-treated brain areas (Fig. 5j,k and Extended Data Fig. 5h). Gene expression analysis of Aβ-associated Mg-2\n\nand Mg-4 ST spots showed increased APOE and FAM107A in AN1792 samples (Fig. 5l) and upregulated APOE , LIPA , SPP1 and TREM2 among lysosomal function and iron metabolism genes in lecanemab-treated regions (Fig. 5m). Pseudobulked fold changes showed that FAM107A is uniquely increased in Mg-2 and Mg-4 Aβ-associated ST spots in AN1792 samples, while SPP1 and LIPA are associated only with lecanemab treatment (Extended Data Fig. 5i). Notably, APOE and TREM2 increased after both treatments (Extended Data Fig. 5i). Using CellChat 45 , we mapped cell-to-cell signaling related to APOE, complement and SPP1 pathways, identifying increased microglial signaling via complement and SPP1 pathways in the lecanemab-treated brain, and elevated APOE signaling in both lecanemab and AN1792 samples (Extended Data Fig. 5j).\n\nTo achieve single-cell resolution, we applied high-definition ST to the HIPP of the lecanemab-treated brain and nAD controls (Extended Data Fig. 5k). Nuclei were segmented 46 , clustered and annotated by top markers (Fig. 5n and Extended Data Fig. 5k,o). We mapped nuclei to Aβ plaques using immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 5o). Myeloid cells, putative microglia, were overrepresented within 20 μm of Aβ plaques in the lecanemab-treated brain but not in nAD controls (Fig. 5o,p). Differential expression analysis confirmed increased expression of SPP1 , APOE and others in microglia near Aβ plaques after lecanemab treatment (Fig. 5q). SPP1 expression was localized to nuclei around Aβ (Fig. 5r). These data validate many of the lower-resolution ST findings throughout the study.\n\nFinally, to identify common and distinct gene expression changes in microglia and at the Aβ plaque niche from AN1792-treated (Figs. 1m, 2e and 5g,l) and lecanemab-treated (Extended Data Fig. 4f and Figs. 3i and 5h,m) brains, we ranked genes by probabilistic fold change (PFC) and assigned percentile ranks. In AN1792 samples, FAM107A was the top response gene, followed by ATP synthase inhibitory factor subunit 1 ( ATP5IF1 ), TREM2 and APOE (Fig. 5s and Extended Data Fig. 5p). In lecanemab-treated brain areas, CHI3L1 , F3 , HMOX1 and SPP1 were the top induced genes (Fig. 5t and Extended Data Fig. 5q). Notably, TREM2 and APOE emerged as common responsive genes in both treatments (Fig. 5u). Our analysis highlights both distinct ( FAM107A , SPP1 ) and common ( APOE , TREM2 ) microglial response genes related to active and passive Aβ immunization.\n\nWe correlated TREM2 and APOE expression with clinical data for AN1792 patients, finding a positive correlation between AN1792 antibody titer and TREM2 / APOE expression in microglia-enriched ST spots (Fig. 5v). There was also a trend toward a negative correlation between APOE expression and Aβ plaque score assessed throughout the neocortex using a standardized method 16 . This shows that the expression levels of microglial APOE and TREM2 were directly associated with the immunization response and Aβ clearance. Altogether, our findings delineate the microglial response mediating Aβ clearance in AD brains immunized against Aβ.', ""Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapies utilizing amyloid-β (Aβ) immunization have shown potential in clinical trials. Yet, the mechanisms driving Aβ clearance in the immunized AD brain remain unclear. Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to explore the effects of both active and passive Aβ immunization in the AD brain. We compare actively immunized patients with AD with nonimmunized patients with AD and neurologically healthy controls, identifying distinct microglial states associated with Aβ clearance. Using high-resolution spatial transcriptomics alongside single-cell RNA sequencing, we delve deeper into the transcriptional pathways involved in Aβ removal after lecanemab treatment. We uncover spatially distinct microglial responses that vary by brain region. Our analysis reveals upregulation of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 ( TREM2 ) and apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) in microglia across immunization approaches, which correlate positively with antibody responses and Aβ removal. Furthermore, we show that complement signaling in brain myeloid cells contributes to Aβ clearance after immunization. These findings provide new insights into the transcriptional mechanisms orchestrating Aβ removal and shed light on the role of microglia in immune-mediated Aβ clearance. Importantly, our work uncovers potential molecular targets that could enhance A  β-  ta  rg  eted i  mm  un  ot  he  ra  pies, offering new avenues for developing more effective therapeutic strategies to combat AD.\n\nCheck for updates\n\nFor nearly three decades, clinical trials have targeted cerebral Aβ accumulation in AD 1 . Leading strategies include active and passive immunization against Aβ 2 . While these strategies can reduce cerebral Aβ 3-9 , they can also trigger adverse side effects 8-15 . Understanding the cellular mechanisms underpinning Aβ immunization is paramount to improving patient outcomes.\n\npostmortem analyses of AN1792 brains revealed Aβ clearance in some immunized patients, likely via microglia 3-5,16 .  However, the microglial mechanisms dictating Aβ clearance in these brains remain unclear.\n\nThe AN1792 clinical trial was the first to actively immunize patients with AD 3 . This trial utilized immunization against a synthetic Aβ 1-42 peptide. Preclinical studies showed promise, but the trial was suspended after some patients developed aseptic meningoencephalitis 10-12 associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) 4,13 . Our prior\n\ne-mail: dgate@northwestern.edu\n\nThe inflammatory side effects from the AN1792 trial led to a shift toward passive immunization. In passive immunization, patients with AD receive antibodies that target Aβ, such as lecanemab. Lecanemab binds large soluble Aβ protofibrils, reduces Aβ markers and slows cognitive decline in early AD 9 . Our prior case study of a lecanemab-treated patient who developed stroke-like symptoms revealed inflammation in blood vessels with CAA and evidence of Aβ clearance 17,18 . Yet, the\n\nfunction of microglia in Aβ clearance in passive immunization also remains unclear.\n\nIn this study, we used spatial transcriptomics (ST) to analyze the neuroimmune response in AD brains following active and passive Aβ immunization. We compared AN1792-immunized Alzheimer's disease (iAD) brains to nonimmunized Alzheimer's disease (nAD) and control, non-neurologic disease (NND) brains. Additionally, we examined the neuroimmune response in the aforementioned patient treated with lecanemab using high-definition ST, spatial proteogenomics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).\n\nOur  study  uncovers  distinct  microglial  phenotypes  in Aβ-immunized AD brains and reveals genes that control clearance of Aβ by microglia.

Using manual annotation and machine learning, we differentiated cortical and vascular Aβ pathology (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Gray matter Aβ quantification showed reduced cortical Aβ in the TCX and PCX of the lecanemab case compared to controls (Fig. 3e). Moreover, a higher fraction of cortical Aβ (~44%) was covered by IBA1 + cells in the lecanemab case versus ~15% in controls (Fig. 3f). These data indicate regional variability in Aβ clearance by myeloid cells.\n\nTo further explore immune responses to Aβ following passive immunization, we performed scRNA-seq on cells isolated from each brain region, and used SoupX 42 to minimize ambient RNA contamination (Extended Data Fig. 3b). We assessed quality-control metrics (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d), integrated cells from all tissues (Extended Data Fig. 3e) and annotated cell clusters using their highly expressed genes (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 3f). The lecanemab case showed a relative increase in GABAergic interneurons and a decrease in endothelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 3g). T cells were enriched in all regions except HIPP, monocytes/macrophages in PCX and TCX, and microglia in TCX, PCX and HIPP (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 3g).\n\nDifferential expression analysis of microglia and macrophages revealed upregulated genes linked to microglial activation ( SPP1 and chitinase 3 like 1 ( CHI3L1 )), lysosomal function (cathepsin B ( CTSB ), granulin ( GRN )), and interferon response (interferon alpha inducible protein 6 ( IFI6 ) in the lecanemab case (Fig. 3i). Additional upregulated genes included those linked to iron storage (ferritin heavy chain 1 ( FTH1 ), ferritin light chain ( FTL )) and lipid metabolism ( APOC1 ; Fig. 3i). SPP1 and APOC1 were the most upregulated genes unique to microglia (Fig. 3j). SPP1 is expressed by activated-response microglia 43 and contributes to tissue repair 44 . We confirmed expression of SPP1 and APOC1 proteins in plaque-associated microglia within the HIPP following lecanemab treatment (Extended Data Fig. 3h,i). Macrophage-specific upregulated genes included TREM2 , APOE and the phagocytosis-associated gene cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68)\n\nthe HIPP of the lecanemab-treated patient. i , LOESS plot of cluster 3 predictions in nAD (left) and lecanemab (right) relative to Aβ density.

DESeq2 ( d ), MAST ( e ) or FindMarkers with a negative binomial model ( g ) was used to compare expression levels. For DESeq2, covariates included brain region, average genes detected and gDNA percentage. In the MAST model, manually annotated region or cortical layer, gDNA percentage and CDR were included as covariates, with brain region and sample ID as a random effect. For FindMarkers, covariates included manually annotated region or cortical layer and CDR. All P values were FDR adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg.\n\nmolecule ( CD68 ; Fig. 3j). Both cell types exhibited decreased HSP gene expression, while heme oxygenase 1 ( HMOX1 ), the most upregulated gene shared between them, reflected an immune response to hemorrhages in the lecanemab case.\n\nTo study microglia and macrophage functions after immunization, we performed enrichment analysis. Pathways regulating vascular functions such as apical junctions, coagulation and angiogenesis were upregulated in macrophages and microglia in the lecanemab case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(Fig. 3k). Additionally, we found dysregulated complement signaling in macrophages and increased complement signaling in microglia (Fig. 3k). We also observed dysregulated IL-2-STAT5 signaling in microglia, with both downregulated and upregulated DEGs associated with this pathway (Fig. 3k). These data highlight distinct alterations to the brain myeloid compartment following passive Aβ immunization.\n\nNotably, microglial transcriptomic signatures in the lecanemab case varied by brain region (Extended Data Fig. 3j). Most changes in microglial gene expression were observed in the TCX and PCX, the two regions with the most Aβ clearance. Microglia from these regions exhibited increased expression of genes involved in complement signaling ( C3 ), lysosomal function and protein degradation (for example, cathepsin genes), iron storage and regulation ( FTH1 , FTL ) and SPP1 (Extended Data Fig. 3j). Regional DEGs were associated with various signaling pathways. In the FCX, DEGs indicated increased reactive oxygen species signaling (Fig. 3l). The TCX and PCX showed increased complement signaling, while the PCX also exhibited decreased interferon responses, among other changes (Fig. 3l). The HIPP demonstrated decreased cholesterol homeostasis (Fig. 3l). Additionally, microglial DEGs were linked to vascular pathways (for example, angiogenesis and coagulation), but this association was present only in the TCX and PCX, areas with extensive Aβ clearance (Fig. 3l). Thus, distinct microglial phenotypes may underlie the variability in Aβ clearance between brain regions of the lecanemab case.\n\nMicroglial states 41 were also altered, with reduced inflammatory MG8 microglia and increased ribosomal biogenesis MG3 microglia across brain regions in the lecanemab case (Extended Data Fig. 3k). In the FCX, where IBA1-Aβ recruitment was low, reductions were seen in inflammatory (MG2, MG8, MG10), phagocytic (MG5), stress-signature (MG6) and glycolytic (MG7) microglia. Conversely, inflammatory MG10 microglia increased in the PCX where IBA1-Aβ recruitment and Aβ clearance were high. Separate microglial classifications 34 showed a similar pattern with several microglial states downregulated in the FCX, that were upregulated in the TCX, PCX and HIPP regions (Extended Data Fig. 3l). These findings reveal a reduction in inflammatory MG8 microglia and an increase in ribosome biogenesis and DAM-expressing MG3 microglia across all brain regions after lecanemab immunization, similar to AN1792. Notably, the FCX displayed a distinct microglial profile compared to other brain regions.\n\nImmune cell sub-clustering identified two microglial states, Mg-2 and Mg-4, that were enriched in lecanemab-treated brain regions with', 'Confocal images showing pan-Aβ and IBA1 in FCX brain regions of nAD, AN1792lim, AN1792-ext and lecanemab-treated patients. b , Percentage of cortical Aβ coverage in cortical and hippocampal regions of AN1792, nAD and the lecanemab case. c , Percentage of cortical Aβ covered by IBA1 in cortical and hippocampal regions of AN1792, nAD and the lecanemab case. d , Clustering of Aβ-rich cortical gray matter spots based on gene expression. e , C2L predictions of scRNA-seq cell types in different Aβ plaque clusters. f , Percentages of Aβ-rich clusters in AN1792, nAD and the lecanemab case. g , h , DEGs in Aβ-rich cluster 6: AN1792 versus nAD ( g ); lecanemab versus nAD ( h ). i , Pseudobulked SPP1 expression in Aβ-rich cluster 6.

Mg-2 exhibited a mixed DAM and homeostatic profile, expressing TREM2 , APOE and homeostatic markers, along with high levels of AXL receptor tyrosine kinase ( AXL ), C3, CD74 and SPP1 (Fig. 3o,p). Mg-4 displayed a classic DAM signature, with elevated ITGAX , lipoprotein lipase (LPL) , matrix metallopeptidase 9 ( MMP9 ), CHI3L1 and SPP1 (Fig. 3o,p). Both clusters showed enhanced complement pathway signaling (Fig. 3q).\n\nIn summary, we identified upregulated genes (for example, SPP1 and APOC1 ) in microglia after lecanemab treatment. Additionally, we observed two distinct microglial phenotypes in brain regions with Aβ clearance, both expressing APOE and TREM2 , and showing increased complement signaling. These findings demonstrate that passive Aβ immunization triggers specific microglial adaptations associated with Aβ clearance.', 'a , Lecanemab binds oligomeric and protofibrillar Aβ to promote Aβ clearance from the brain.

Using separate microglial classifications 34 showed a reduction in stress-responsive microglia (Mic.11), surveilling microglia (Mic.2, Mic.4), reactive microglia (Mic.6-Mic.8), interferon-responsive microglia (Mic.14) and serpin family E member 1 ( SERPINE1 )-expressing microglia (Mic.16) after immunization (Fig. 2q).\n\nOverall, active Aβ immunization reduces stress-responsive microglia irrespective of residual Aβ levels. Yet, microglia in iAD-ext shifted from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, while iAD-lim showed decreased complement and unfolded protein responses with upregulated phagocytosis genes. These findings suggest that effective Aβ clearance relies on balanced microglial metabolic states that also protect against Aβ neurotoxicity.', 'Community 0: Contains concepts [""Alzheimer\'s disease"", \'heightened immune response\']...', 'Community 3: Contains concepts [\'Nrf2\', \'NF-kB\', ""Alzheimer\'s Disease"", \'JAK/STAT\', \'Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway\']...', ""Community 5: Contains concepts ['GSK3β signaling', 'pathophysiology of AD']...""]","Spatial transcriptomics (ST) data can distinguish between microglial activation states driven by local Aβ burden versus systemic immune signaling by analyzing gene expression patterns in specific spatial locations within the brain [2]. Here's how:

*   **Aβ Niche Analysis:** ST allows for the identification of Aβ-rich spots in the gray matter and the clustering of these spots based on gene expression [1]. Differential gene expression analysis of these Aβ-rich spots can reveal distinct microglial responses in different conditions [1]. For example, the ""cortical Aβ-6 cluster"" was enriched in microglia and prominent in lecanemab-treated samples [1].

*   **Microglial Subtype Mapping:** ST can map previously identified microglial subtypes to Aβ-rich spots [1]. This reveals the enrichment of specific microglial subtypes (e.g., Mg-2 and Mg-4) in Aβ niches in treated brain areas [1, 4]. Further gene expression analysis of these subtype-specific ST spots can identify unique gene expression signatures associated with each treatment [1].

*   **Differential Gene Expression:** By comparing gene expression in Aβ-associated microglia between different treatment groups (e.g., AN1792 vs. nAD, lecanemab vs. nAD), ST can identify upregulated genes specific to each condition [1]. For example, *FAM107A* was uniquely increased in Mg-2 and Mg-4 Aβ-associated ST spots in AN1792 samples, while *SPP1* and *LIPA* were associated only with lecanemab treatment [1]. *APOE* and *TREM2* were common responsive genes in both treatments [1].

*   **High-Definition ST:** High-definition ST can provide single-cell resolution, allowing for the mapping of nuclei to Aβ plaques using immunofluorescence staining [1]. Differential expression analysis can then confirm increased expression of specific genes (e.g., *SPP1*, *APOE*) in microglia near Aβ plaques after specific treatments [1].

*   **Cell-Cell Signaling:** ST data can be used to map cell-to-cell signaling pathways related to *APOE*, complement, and *SPP1*, revealing increased microglial signaling via complement and *SPP1* pathways in lecanemab-treated brains and elevated *APOE* signaling in both lecanemab and AN1792 samples [1].

*   **Regional Variability:** ST can reveal regional variability in microglial transcriptomic signatures [3]. For example, most changes in microglial gene expression in the lecanemab case were observed in the TCX and PCX, the two regions with the most Aβ clearance [3].

By analyzing these spatial gene expression patterns, researchers can distinguish between microglial activation states driven by local Aβ burden (reflected in the expression of genes related to Aβ processing and clearance) and those driven by systemic immune signaling (reflected in the expression of genes related to inflammation and immune response) [1, 3].",1.0,0.8292928363660629,8,gemini-2.0-flash
