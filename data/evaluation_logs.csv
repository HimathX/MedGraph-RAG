2026-01-31T10:27:14.359805,how spatial transcriptomics data could distinguish between microglial activation states driven by local Aβ burden versus systemic immune signaling?,"Spatial transcriptomics data could potentially distinguish between microglial activation states driven by local Aβ burden versus systemic immune signaling by analyzing gene expression patterns in specific brain regions [3]. This approach allows for the examination of how microglia respond to Aβ plaques in their immediate vicinity versus how they respond to signals originating from the peripheral immune system [1, 4].

Here's how spatial transcriptomics could differentiate these activation states:

1.  **Identifying Region-Specific Gene Expression:** Spatial transcriptomics can reveal unique gene expression signatures of microglia located near Aβ plaques compared to microglia in regions with less Aβ burden [3]. For example, microglia directly interacting with Aβ may show increased expression of genes related to phagocytosis, inflammasome activation (e.g., NLRP3), and Aβ clearance [1].

2.  **Distinguishing Systemic Inflammatory Signatures:** Microglia responding to systemic immune signals might exhibit a different gene expression profile, potentially involving the upregulation of genes associated with general immune response pathways like interferon signaling or cytokine production [5]. Comparing these gene signatures with those of microglia near Aβ plaques can help differentiate between local and systemic influences.

3.  **Analyzing Spatial Relationships:** Spatial analysis can identify correlations between microglial activation states and the proximity to Aβ plaques, blood vessels (as entry points for systemic immune factors), or other cell types (e.g., astrocytes, neurons) [3, 4]. This can help determine whether microglial activation is primarily driven by local Aβ or influenced by broader inflammatory signals.

4.  **Pathway Enrichment Analysis:** Analyzing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in microglia using pathway enrichment analysis can reveal which pathways are activated in response to Aβ versus systemic signals [3]. For instance, Aβ-driven activation might show enrichment for pathways related to Aβ processing and clearance, while systemic immune signaling might show enrichment for general inflammatory pathways [1, 5].

By combining spatial transcriptomics with other techniques like spatial proteogenomics, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying microglial activation in AD [3]. This can lead to the identification of specific targets for therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating microglial activity and reducing neuroinflammation [4, 5].",8,how spatial transcriptomics data could distinguish between microglial activation states driven by local Aβ burden versus systemic immune signaling?,"[""Microglia  are  yolk-sac  derived  myeloid  cells  that  carry  out  many critical  functions  in  the  brain  from  maintaining  homeostasis,  modulating  neuronal  activity  and  importantly,  mediating  the  immune response  of  the  central  nervous  system  (CNS).  These  cells  are  the guardians  of  the  brain.  Microglia  are  highly  phagocytic  and  by expressing an array of PRRs to detect PAMPs or DAMPs, along with constantly  surveying  their  microenvironment,  they  are  poised  to respond to any threat or injury they encounter. However, unlike other tissues and organs, the brain is very sensitive to inflammation. Therefore, the microglial inflammatory response must be carefully regulated to limit the damage to neighbouring neurons and later support remodelling or repair. There are also number of receptor-ligand interactions\n\nR.M. McManus and E. Latz between microglia and astrocytes or neurons to maintain the microglia in a regulated state (Manich et al., 2019; Finneran and Nash, 2019). This is a very delicate balance, and the microglial response easily becomes disordered in diseases of the brain.\n\nWhen Alois Alzheimer first described Alzheimer ' s disease in 1907, he already  noted  the  presence  of  abnormal  glial  cells  neighbouring  the amyloid plaques (Alzheimer et al., 1995). We now know that microglia have a key role in the progression and development of AD. Genome-wide association  studies  (GWAS)  have  identified  many  microglial-specific genes that increase the risk for developing AD, such as Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), CD33 and complement receptor 1 (CR1) (Naj et al., 2011; Bellenguez et al., 2022), many of which affect microglial phagocytosis (Butler et al., 2021; Ulrich et al., 2014). In 2008, Halle and colleagues first showed that when microglia phagocytose A β it triggers activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Halle et  al.,  2008),  thus  firmly  establishing the  role of innate immune signalling in this neurodegenerative disease."", 'Human MSigDB . Gene lists were analyzed using the enrichR package 57 with the hallmark gene-set collection from the Human MSigDB. For lists containing specifically downregulated genes, combined scores were negated. A significance threshold was set at a BenjaminiHochberg-adjusted P value of 0.05.\n\nMicroglia states . Signed probability fold change was calculated for each gene as the product of the negative logarithm of the adjusted P value and the log 2 fold change. Enrichment for human microglial activation states 34,41 was assessed using the fgsea package, with probability fold change as the ranking metric. Custom gene sets associated with various microglial activation states were compiled from the supplementary materials provided in the referenced studies. Normalized enrichment scores were calculated, and significance was determined through permutation testing, with P values adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. A threshold of 0.05 was applied for adjusted P values, with no specific cutoff for the magnitude of NES values.', 'a , Lecanemab binds oligomeric and protofibrillar Aβ to promote Aβ clearance from the brain.

Using separate microglial classifications 34 showed a reduction in stress-responsive microglia (Mic.11), surveilling microglia (Mic.2, Mic.4), reactive microglia (Mic.6-Mic.8), interferon-responsive microglia (Mic.14) and serpin family E member 1 ( SERPINE1 )-expressing microglia (Mic.16) after immunization (Fig. 2q).\n\nOverall, active Aβ immunization reduces stress-responsive microglia irrespective of residual Aβ levels. Yet, microglia in iAD-ext shifted from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, while iAD-lim showed decreased complement and unfolded protein responses with upregulated phagocytosis genes. These findings suggest that effective Aβ clearance relies on balanced microglial metabolic states that also protect against Aβ neurotoxicity.', 'Inflammation is a response produced towards any injury, trauma or infection to the cells and tissues. It is believed that brain and immune system has a biochemical link. Inflammation that occurs in the brain is known as neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation is sometimes beneficial and sometimes destructing to the neuronal cells as over-activation of the inflammatory molecules can cause damage to the cells of the brain (Fig.\xa02) (Shabab et\xa0al. 2017). Neuroinflammation leads to activation of inflammatory cells in the brain including microglia and astrocytes. The brain is regarded as an ""immunological privileged organ"" because peripheral immune cells are expected not to enter the blood-brain barrier. Rather, glial cells-microglia and astrocytes, are the primary component of the committed neuroimmune system, and interrelate with peripheral immunity but not clearly justified. The glial cells provide favorable and anti-inflammatory actions under normal and pathological conditions, counting phagocytosis, steroid release, free radical depletion, and repairing of cells. Release of cytokines and generation of free radicals can cause neuronal cell death and synaptic dysfunction. So if there is imbalance between the regulations of proinflammatory anti-inflammatory function, it can cause brain injury (Schain and Kreisl 2017).\n\nMicroglia and astrocytes are the two main constituents of the immune system of brain and they have a key function in the neuroinflammation process. In normal conditions microglia have a phagocytic action which removes\n\nFig. 2 Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer\'s disease. Figure\xa02 shows the hyperactive glial cells including astrocytes and microglia upon interaction between Aβ and tau. Microglia and astrocytes are the major cells in the brain responsible for inflammatory responses. Due to the activation of glial cells various pro-inflammatory mediators are released which direct more inflammatory molecules at the site of injury leading to exaggerated inflammatory response in brain called neuroinflammation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndamaged neurons thus encourages the repair of tissue at the site of invasion by foreign molecules or pathogens where the immune functions of the cells are initiated. Astrocytes remove the debris from the cerebrospinal fluid and play a neuroprotective role. In Alzheimer\'s disease there is accretion of these cells around the NFTs and senile plaques. In activated state these cells release cytokines, interleukins and chemokines which act as pro-inflammatory components and potentiate the neuroinflammatory process in the brain contributing to AD (Walters et\xa0al. 2016).\n\nApoE is the risk element for Alzheimer disease that possesses immunomodulatory action. This capacity of ApoE is conjugated with triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which is mediated by microglia in the CNS (Shi et\xa0al. 2018). Elevated levels of cytokines in the brain are closely linked with AD. The interleukins and TNF α along with Cox-2 are the major cytokines considered to be involved. Cytokines generation in the brain mediated by Aβ also promotes microglia mediated free radical generation. In general IL-1 is involved in the progression of AD which is released from neurons, astrocytes and microglia. IL-1 enhances the abnormal processing of APP and generates Aβ. There is an increased concentration of IL-1 in the brain of AD patients. Aβ is generally considered to increase the interleukin levels. In contrast, it is seen that interleukins are responsible to generate Aβ from neurons and astrocytes. IL-1 also induces the release of other cytokines and increase NOS activity which results in toxicity of neurons (Sawikr et\xa0al. 2017).', 'There is an intricate link between the immune system and CNS; when this balance is broken, it can cause neuroinflammation  and,  ultimately,  AD.  Neuroinflammation  is an inflammatory response in the CNS caused by various pathological injuries. In this process, CNS glial cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, produce various pro-inflammatory  cytokines,  such  as  Interleukin-1β  (IL-1β),  IL-6, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and chemokines, as well  as  small  molecule  messengers  and  reactive  oxygen species [31]. CNS glial cells thus play an important role in the progression of inflammation.\n\nStem  cell  technology  allows  researchers  to  study  the interplay between immune function and AD using models like co-culture of immune cells from a single patient with  their  organoids  [82].  As  stem  cell-derived  3D  cultures  can  generate  human  oligodendrocyte  spheroids, astrocyte  spheroids,  and  neurons,  these  models  can  be applied to investigate glial cell functional abnormalities, different glial cell interactions, neuronal interaction networks,  and  the  mechanisms  of  AD  immune  disorders. Bianco et\xa0al. [10] used a microfluidic platform to investigate  the  complex  roles  of  different  regional  astrocytes in  neuroinflammation.  They  inoculated  astrocytes  from the  cortex  and  hippocampus,  as  well  as  primary  hippocampal neuron cell types, from rat embryos in different chambers of the microfluidic network. By examining the effects on neuronal viability in two neuroinflammatory  injury  models  (i.e.,  metabolic  stress  and  exposure to  amyloid  β  protofibrils),  they  clarified  the  differential contributions  of  brain  region-specific  neuroglia  in  two in\xa0 vitro  models.  This  study  reflects  the  superiority  of 3D microfluidic  organ  chips  with  multiple  chambers  to independently control culture conditions and selectively differentiate stem cells into different cell types with different stimuli. As this is also an open-ended method, it allows  close  monitoring  of  the  specific  contribution  of each cell type by analyzing morphology, viability, calcium kinetic, and electrophysiological parameters when different chambers are micro fluidically connected [10]. Such models can reveal the complexity of cell-cell interactions in  neuroinflammation, which is of great importance for elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved. To study the  effect  of  the  immune  system  on  neuronal  signaling, Guttikonda et\xa0al. [44] established a well-defined human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC)-derived tri-culture system containing pure populations of hPSC-derived microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. Using this culture system, they were able to demonstrate that increased complement C3 production in the brain is partly\xa0caused by microglia activation and its\xa0interaction with astrocytes, which in turn worsens neuroinflammation [44].\n\nSynthetic  models  with  AD  features  have  also  been developed. For example, Park et\xa0al. [95] used this technique  to  create  a  human  ternary  culture  model  containing  NPC-derived  neurons  and  astrocytes  as  well  as immortalized  human  microglia.  This  method  reflected the  phenomena  of  microglia  recruitment,  neurotoxic activity,  and  nitrogen  monoxide (NO) release damaging AD  neurons  and  astrocytes  and  is  suitable  for  further investigating the complex molecular mechanisms of neuroinflammation that underlie AD pathology [95]. Human pluripotent stem cell-derived brain-like Organoids\n\nco-cultured with immune cells from AD patients can also be used to better understand inter-glial interactions and provide  an  ideal  experimental  platform  to  explore  the mechanisms of AD immune dysfunction under an in\xa0vivo growth environment.\n\nAs a proof of concept, we can use patient-derived stem cell platforms to study the role of the immune system and various glial cell communication disorders in the development of AD. This represents a paradigm shift in understanding  the  role  of  immunity  in  human  disease  and opens new avenues for AD research and treatment. In the future, new models could be developed to evaluate novel therapeutical interventions for AD such as immunomodulatory therapy, anti-inflammatory drugs, and immunoglobulin therapy.\n\nIn  summary,  reprogramming  somatic  cells  from  AD patients  back  to  stem  cells  that  can  be  re-differentiated into in\xa0vitro disease models to probe disease progression and  pathogenesis  provides  a  new  approach  for  understanding  the  pathogenesis  of  human  neurodegenerative  diseases.  This  approach  also  takes  advantage  of  the reverse engineering platform to monitor and determine key  pathogenetic  events  during  disease  development. The hallmark of degeneration of the aging brain is selective  cell  vulnerability  in  disease-specific  patterns  many decades after the birth of long-lived brain cells. The traditional  paradigm  for  investigating  neurodegeneration has  been  to  define  the  biological  processes  and  pathways mediating brain cell dysfunction and death during the adult life; neurodegenerative diseases have thus been considered  a  discrete  pathological  entity  rather  than  a continuum  of  a  common  pathogenic  process.  The  new perspective  considers  neurodegenerative  diseases  as  a fundamental  disorder  of  neural  development  in  which subtle impairment in the regional programming of neural  development  results  in  selective  neural  and  brain network vulnerability to a spectrum of late-life stressors. Indeed, emerging data support the possibility of pathogenic associations between abnormalities in the birth and death of vulnerable brain cell subtypes [210].', 'Community 0: Contains concepts [""Alzheimer\'s disease"", \'heightened immune response\']...', 'Community 3: Contains concepts [\'Nrf2\', \'NF-kB\', ""Alzheimer\'s Disease"", \'JAK/STAT\', \'Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway\']...', ""Community 5: Contains concepts ['GSK3β signaling', 'pathophysiology of AD']...""]","Spatial transcriptomics data could potentially distinguish between microglial activation states driven by local Aβ burden versus systemic immune signaling by analyzing gene expression patterns in specific brain regions [3].

2026-01-31T10:35:37.365273,how spatial transcriptomics data could distinguish between microglial activation states driven by local Aβ burden versus systemic immune signaling?,"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) data can distinguish between microglial activation states driven by local Aβ burden versus systemic immune signaling by analyzing gene expression patterns in specific spatial locations within the brain [2]. Here's how:

*   **Aβ Niche Analysis:** ST allows for the identification of Aβ-rich spots in the gray matter and the clustering of these spots based on gene expression [1]. Differential gene expression analysis of these Aβ-rich spots can reveal distinct microglial responses in different conditions [1]. For example, the ""cortical Aβ-6 cluster"" was enriched in microglia and prominent in lecanemab-treated samples [1].

*   **Microglial Subtype Mapping:** ST can map previously identified microglial subtypes to Aβ-rich spots [1]. This reveals the enrichment of specific microglial subtypes (e.g., Mg-2 and Mg-4) in Aβ niches in treated brain areas [1, 4]. Further gene expression analysis of these subtype-specific ST spots can identify unique gene expression signatures associated with each treatment [1].

*   **Differential Gene Expression:** By comparing gene expression in Aβ-associated microglia between different treatment groups (e.g., AN1792 vs. nAD, lecanemab vs. nAD), ST can identify upregulated genes specific to each condition [1]. For example, *FAM107A* was uniquely increased in Mg-2 and Mg-4 Aβ-associated ST spots in AN1792 samples, while *SPP1* and *LIPA* were associated only with lecanemab treatment [1]. *APOE* and *TREM2* were common responsive genes in both treatments [1].

*   **High-Definition ST:** High-definition ST can provide single-cell resolution, allowing for the mapping of nuclei to Aβ plaques using immunofluorescence staining [1]. Differential expression analysis can then confirm increased expression of specific genes (e.g., *SPP1*, *APOE*) in microglia near Aβ plaques after specific treatments [1].

*   **Cell-Cell Signaling:** ST data can be used to map cell-to-cell signaling pathways related to *APOE*, complement, and *SPP1*, revealing increased microglial signaling via complement and *SPP1* pathways in lecanemab-treated brains and elevated *APOE* signaling in both lecanemab and AN1792 samples [1].

*   **Regional Variability:** ST can reveal regional variability in microglial transcriptomic signatures [3]. For example, most changes in microglial gene expression in the lecanemab case were observed in the TCX and PCX, the two regions with the most Aβ clearance [3].

By analyzing these spatial gene expression patterns, researchers can distinguish between microglial activation states driven by local Aβ burden (reflected in the expression of genes related to Aβ processing and clearance) and those driven by systemic immune signaling (reflected in the expression of genes related to inflammation and immune response) [1, 3].",8,how spatial transcriptomics data could distinguish between microglial activation states driven by local Aβ burden versus systemic immune signaling?,"['To identify common and distinct microglial responses to Aβ after active and passive immunization, we integrated analyses of all tissues. We quantified Aβ coverage in the gray matter, confirming a decrease in coverage associated with immunization (Fig. 5a, b). Additionally, we observed increased myeloid recruitment to Aβ (Fig. 5c). To examine cellular responses to Aβ, we integrated and clustered cortical gray matter Aβ-rich ST spots (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). This yielded nine distinct Aβ niche clusters based on gene expression (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 5c). We hypothesized that these differences were driven by distinct cellular microenvironments and tested this by using C2L to predict cell-type abundances from our integrated scRNA-seq atlas (Extended Data Fig. 5d). The cortical Aβ-6 cluster, enriched in microglia, was most prominent in the lecanemab sample, followed by a lesser increase in AN1792 samples (Fig. 5f). This cluster was defined by expression of A2M , APOE , C1QC , C3 , SPP1 and others (Extended Data Fig. 5e). Thus, the cortical Aβ-6 cluster likely represents Aβ-rich ST spots with recruited myeloid cells. In AN1792 samples with limited Aβ clearance and in lecanemab-treated brain regions, this cluster showed higher microglia abundance of Mg-2 and Mg-4 compared to nAD controls (Extended Data Fig. 5f).\n\nDifferential expression analysis of Aβ-6 ST spots between AN1792 and nAD samples identified upregulation of FAM107A , RAB13 , TREM2 and others in AN1792 samples (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 5g). In lecanemab-treated ST spots, we observed upregulation of A2M , APOE and others (Fig. 5h and Extended Data Fig. 5g). SPP1 lacked zero counts, making the MAST hurdle model unsuitable. Using DESeq2, we revealed that SPP1 was highly upregulated in lecanemab-treated cortical Aβ-6 ST spots (Fig. 5i). We plotted previously identified microglial subtypes in Aβ-rich ST spots, finding enrichment of Mg-2 and Mg-4 microglia subtypes in Aβ niches of lecanemab-treated brain areas (Fig. 5j,k and Extended Data Fig. 5h). Gene expression analysis of Aβ-associated Mg-2\n\nand Mg-4 ST spots showed increased APOE and FAM107A in AN1792 samples (Fig. 5l) and upregulated APOE , LIPA , SPP1 and TREM2 among lysosomal function and iron metabolism genes in lecanemab-treated regions (Fig. 5m). Pseudobulked fold changes showed that FAM107A is uniquely increased in Mg-2 and Mg-4 Aβ-associated ST spots in AN1792 samples, while SPP1 and LIPA are associated only with lecanemab treatment (Extended Data Fig. 5i). Notably, APOE and TREM2 increased after both treatments (Extended Data Fig. 5i). Using CellChat 45 , we mapped cell-to-cell signaling related to APOE, complement and SPP1 pathways, identifying increased microglial signaling via complement and SPP1 pathways in the lecanemab-treated brain, and elevated APOE signaling in both lecanemab and AN1792 samples (Extended Data Fig. 5j).\n\nTo achieve single-cell resolution, we applied high-definition ST to the HIPP of the lecanemab-treated brain and nAD controls (Extended Data Fig. 5k). Nuclei were segmented 46 , clustered and annotated by top markers (Fig. 5n and Extended Data Fig. 5k,o). We mapped nuclei to Aβ plaques using immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 5o). Myeloid cells, putative microglia, were overrepresented within 20 μm of Aβ plaques in the lecanemab-treated brain but not in nAD controls (Fig. 5o,p). Differential expression analysis confirmed increased expression of SPP1 , APOE and others in microglia near Aβ plaques after lecanemab treatment (Fig. 5q). SPP1 expression was localized to nuclei around Aβ (Fig. 5r). These data validate many of the lower-resolution ST findings throughout the study.\n\nFinally, to identify common and distinct gene expression changes in microglia and at the Aβ plaque niche from AN1792-treated (Figs. 1m, 2e and 5g,l) and lecanemab-treated (Extended Data Fig. 4f and Figs. 3i and 5h,m) brains, we ranked genes by probabilistic fold change (PFC) and assigned percentile ranks. In AN1792 samples, FAM107A was the top response gene, followed by ATP synthase inhibitory factor subunit 1 ( ATP5IF1 ), TREM2 and APOE (Fig. 5s and Extended Data Fig. 5p). In lecanemab-treated brain areas, CHI3L1 , F3 , HMOX1 and SPP1 were the top induced genes (Fig. 5t and Extended Data Fig. 5q). Notably, TREM2 and APOE emerged as common responsive genes in both treatments (Fig. 5u). Our analysis highlights both distinct ( FAM107A , SPP1 ) and common ( APOE , TREM2 ) microglial response genes related to active and passive Aβ immunization.\n\nWe correlated TREM2 and APOE expression with clinical data for AN1792 patients, finding a positive correlation between AN1792 antibody titer and TREM2 / APOE expression in microglia-enriched ST spots (Fig. 5v). There was also a trend toward a negative correlation between APOE expression and Aβ plaque score assessed throughout the neocortex using a standardized method 16 . This shows that the expression levels of microglial APOE and TREM2 were directly associated with the immunization response and Aβ clearance. Altogether, our findings delineate the microglial response mediating Aβ clearance in AD brains immunized against Aβ.', ""Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapies utilizing amyloid-β (Aβ) immunization have shown potential in clinical trials. Yet, the mechanisms driving Aβ clearance in the immunized AD brain remain unclear. Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to explore the effects of both active and passive Aβ immunization in the AD brain. We compare actively immunized patients with AD with nonimmunized patients with AD and neurologically healthy controls, identifying distinct microglial states associated with Aβ clearance. Using high-resolution spatial transcriptomics alongside single-cell RNA sequencing, we delve deeper into the transcriptional pathways involved in Aβ removal after lecanemab treatment. We uncover spatially distinct microglial responses that vary by brain region. Our analysis reveals upregulation of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 ( TREM2 ) and apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) in microglia across immunization approaches, which correlate positively with antibody responses and Aβ removal. Furthermore, we show that complement signaling in brain myeloid cells contributes to Aβ clearance after immunization. These findings provide new insights into the transcriptional mechanisms orchestrating Aβ removal and shed light on the role of microglia in immune-mediated Aβ clearance. Importantly, our work uncovers potential molecular targets that could enhance A  β-  ta  rg  eted i  mm  un  ot  he  ra  pies, offering new avenues for developing more effective therapeutic strategies to combat AD.\n\nCheck for updates\n\nFor nearly three decades, clinical trials have targeted cerebral Aβ accumulation in AD 1 . Leading strategies include active and passive immunization against Aβ 2 . While these strategies can reduce cerebral Aβ 3-9 , they can also trigger adverse side effects 8-15 . Understanding the cellular mechanisms underpinning Aβ immunization is paramount to improving patient outcomes.\n\npostmortem analyses of AN1792 brains revealed Aβ clearance in some immunized patients, likely via microglia 3-5,16 .  However, the microglial mechanisms dictating Aβ clearance in these brains remain unclear.\n\nThe AN1792 clinical trial was the first to actively immunize patients with AD 3 . This trial utilized immunization against a synthetic Aβ 1-42 peptide. Preclinical studies showed promise, but the trial was suspended after some patients developed aseptic meningoencephalitis 10-12 associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) 4,13 . Our prior\n\ne-mail: dgate@northwestern.edu\n\nThe inflammatory side effects from the AN1792 trial led to a shift toward passive immunization. In passive immunization, patients with AD receive antibodies that target Aβ, such as lecanemab. Lecanemab binds large soluble Aβ protofibrils, reduces Aβ markers and slows cognitive decline in early AD 9 . Our prior case study of a lecanemab-treated patient who developed stroke-like symptoms revealed inflammation in blood vessels with CAA and evidence of Aβ clearance 17,18 . Yet, the\n\nfunction of microglia in Aβ clearance in passive immunization also remains unclear.\n\nIn this study, we used spatial transcriptomics (ST) to analyze the neuroimmune response in AD brains following active and passive Aβ immunization. We compared AN1792-immunized Alzheimer's disease (iAD) brains to nonimmunized Alzheimer's disease (nAD) and control, non-neurologic disease (NND) brains. Additionally, we examined the neuroimmune response in the aforementioned patient treated with lecanemab using high-definition ST, spatial proteogenomics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).\n\nOur  study  uncovers  distinct  microglial  phenotypes  in Aβ-immunized AD brains and reveals genes that control clearance of Aβ by microglia.

Using manual annotation and machine learning, we differentiated cortical and vascular Aβ pathology (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Gray matter Aβ quantification showed reduced cortical Aβ in the TCX and PCX of the lecanemab case compared to controls (Fig. 3e). Moreover, a higher fraction of cortical Aβ (~44%) was covered by IBA1 + cells in the lecanemab case versus ~15% in controls (Fig. 3f). These data indicate regional variability in Aβ clearance by myeloid cells.\n\nTo further explore immune responses to Aβ following passive immunization, we performed scRNA-seq on cells isolated from each brain region, and used SoupX 42 to minimize ambient RNA contamination (Extended Data Fig. 3b). We assessed quality-control metrics (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d), integrated cells from all tissues (Extended Data Fig. 3e) and annotated cell clusters using their highly expressed genes (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 3f). The lecanemab case showed a relative increase in GABAergic interneurons and a decrease in endothelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 3g). T cells were enriched in all regions except HIPP, monocytes/macrophages in PCX and TCX, and microglia in TCX, PCX and HIPP (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 3g).\n\nDifferential expression analysis of microglia and macrophages revealed upregulated genes linked to microglial activation ( SPP1 and chitinase 3 like 1 ( CHI3L1 )), lysosomal function (cathepsin B ( CTSB ), granulin ( GRN )), and interferon response (interferon alpha inducible protein 6 ( IFI6 ) in the lecanemab case (Fig. 3i). Additional upregulated genes included those linked to iron storage (ferritin heavy chain 1 ( FTH1 ), ferritin light chain ( FTL )) and lipid metabolism ( APOC1 ; Fig. 3i). SPP1 and APOC1 were the most upregulated genes unique to microglia (Fig. 3j). SPP1 is expressed by activated-response microglia 43 and contributes to tissue repair 44 . We confirmed expression of SPP1 and APOC1 proteins in plaque-associated microglia within the HIPP following lecanemab treatment (Extended Data Fig. 3h,i). Macrophage-specific upregulated genes included TREM2 , APOE and the phagocytosis-associated gene cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68)\n\nthe HIPP of the lecanemab-treated patient. i , LOESS plot of cluster 3 predictions in nAD (left) and lecanemab (right) relative to Aβ density.

DESeq2 ( d ), MAST ( e ) or FindMarkers with a negative binomial model ( g ) was used to compare expression levels. For DESeq2, covariates included brain region, average genes detected and gDNA percentage. In the MAST model, manually annotated region or cortical layer, gDNA percentage and CDR were included as covariates, with brain region and sample ID as a random effect. For FindMarkers, covariates included manually annotated region or cortical layer and CDR. All P values were FDR adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg.\n\nmolecule ( CD68 ; Fig. 3j). Both cell types exhibited decreased HSP gene expression, while heme oxygenase 1 ( HMOX1 ), the most upregulated gene shared between them, reflected an immune response to hemorrhages in the lecanemab case.\n\nTo study microglia and macrophage functions after immunization, we performed enrichment analysis. Pathways regulating vascular functions such as apical junctions, coagulation and angiogenesis were upregulated in macrophages and microglia in the lecanemab case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(Fig. 3k). Additionally, we found dysregulated complement signaling in macrophages and increased complement signaling in microglia (Fig. 3k). We also observed dysregulated IL-2-STAT5 signaling in microglia, with both downregulated and upregulated DEGs associated with this pathway (Fig. 3k). These data highlight distinct alterations to the brain myeloid compartment following passive Aβ immunization.\n\nNotably, microglial transcriptomic signatures in the lecanemab case varied by brain region (Extended Data Fig. 3j). Most changes in microglial gene expression were observed in the TCX and PCX, the two regions with the most Aβ clearance. Microglia from these regions exhibited increased expression of genes involved in complement signaling ( C3 ), lysosomal function and protein degradation (for example, cathepsin genes), iron storage and regulation ( FTH1 , FTL ) and SPP1 (Extended Data Fig. 3j). Regional DEGs were associated with various signaling pathways. In the FCX, DEGs indicated increased reactive oxygen species signaling (Fig. 3l). The TCX and PCX showed increased complement signaling, while the PCX also exhibited decreased interferon responses, among other changes (Fig. 3l). The HIPP demonstrated decreased cholesterol homeostasis (Fig. 3l). Additionally, microglial DEGs were linked to vascular pathways (for example, angiogenesis and coagulation), but this association was present only in the TCX and PCX, areas with extensive Aβ clearance (Fig. 3l). Thus, distinct microglial phenotypes may underlie the variability in Aβ clearance between brain regions of the lecanemab case.\n\nMicroglial states 41 were also altered, with reduced inflammatory MG8 microglia and increased ribosomal biogenesis MG3 microglia across brain regions in the lecanemab case (Extended Data Fig. 3k). In the FCX, where IBA1-Aβ recruitment was low, reductions were seen in inflammatory (MG2, MG8, MG10), phagocytic (MG5), stress-signature (MG6) and glycolytic (MG7) microglia. Conversely, inflammatory MG10 microglia increased in the PCX where IBA1-Aβ recruitment and Aβ clearance were high. Separate microglial classifications 34 showed a similar pattern with several microglial states downregulated in the FCX, that were upregulated in the TCX, PCX and HIPP regions (Extended Data Fig. 3l). These findings reveal a reduction in inflammatory MG8 microglia and an increase in ribosome biogenesis and DAM-expressing MG3 microglia across all brain regions after lecanemab immunization, similar to AN1792. Notably, the FCX displayed a distinct microglial profile compared to other brain regions.\n\nImmune cell sub-clustering identified two microglial states, Mg-2 and Mg-4, that were enriched in lecanemab-treated brain regions with', 'Confocal images showing pan-Aβ and IBA1 in FCX brain regions of nAD, AN1792lim, AN1792-ext and lecanemab-treated patients. b , Percentage of cortical Aβ coverage in cortical and hippocampal regions of AN1792, nAD and the lecanemab case. c , Percentage of cortical Aβ covered by IBA1 in cortical and hippocampal regions of AN1792, nAD and the lecanemab case. d , Clustering of Aβ-rich cortical gray matter spots based on gene expression. e , C2L predictions of scRNA-seq cell types in different Aβ plaque clusters. f , Percentages of Aβ-rich clusters in AN1792, nAD and the lecanemab case. g , h , DEGs in Aβ-rich cluster 6: AN1792 versus nAD ( g ); lecanemab versus nAD ( h ). i , Pseudobulked SPP1 expression in Aβ-rich cluster 6.

Mg-2 exhibited a mixed DAM and homeostatic profile, expressing TREM2 , APOE and homeostatic markers, along with high levels of AXL receptor tyrosine kinase ( AXL ), C3, CD74 and SPP1 (Fig. 3o,p). Mg-4 displayed a classic DAM signature, with elevated ITGAX , lipoprotein lipase (LPL) , matrix metallopeptidase 9 ( MMP9 ), CHI3L1 and SPP1 (Fig. 3o,p). Both clusters showed enhanced complement pathway signaling (Fig. 3q).\n\nIn summary, we identified upregulated genes (for example, SPP1 and APOC1 ) in microglia after lecanemab treatment. Additionally, we observed two distinct microglial phenotypes in brain regions with Aβ clearance, both expressing APOE and TREM2 , and showing increased complement signaling. These findings demonstrate that passive Aβ immunization triggers specific microglial adaptations associated with Aβ clearance.', 'a , Lecanemab binds oligomeric and protofibrillar Aβ to promote Aβ clearance from the brain.

Yet, microglia in iAD-ext shifted from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, while iAD-lim showed decreased complement and unfolded protein responses with upregulated phagocytosis genes. These findings suggest that effective Aβ clearance relies on balanced microglial metabolic states that also protect against Aβ neurotoxicity.', 'Community 0: Contains concepts [""Alzheimer\'s disease"", \'heightened immune response\']...', 'Community 3: Contains concepts [\'Nrf2\', \'NF-kB\', ""Alzheimer\'s Disease"", \'JAK/STAT\', \'Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway\']...', ""Community 5: Contains concepts ['GSK3β signaling', 'pathophysiology of AD']...""]","Spatial transcriptomics (ST) data can distinguish between microglial activation states driven by local Aβ burden versus systemic immune signaling by analyzing gene expression patterns in specific spatial locations within the brain [2]. Here's how:

*   **Aβ Niche Analysis:** ST allows for the identification of Aβ-rich spots in the gray matter and the clustering of these spots based on gene expression [1]. Differential gene expression analysis of these Aβ-rich spots can reveal distinct microglial responses in different conditions [1]. For example, the ""cortical Aβ-6 cluster"" was enriched in microglia and prominent in lecanemab-treated samples [1].

*   **Microglial Subtype Mapping:** ST can map previously identified microglial subtypes to Aβ-rich spots [1]. This reveals the enrichment of specific microglial subtypes (e.g., Mg-2 and Mg-4) in Aβ niches in treated brain areas [1, 4]. Further gene expression analysis of these subtype-specific ST spots can identify unique gene expression signatures associated with each treatment [1].

*   **Differential Gene Expression:** By comparing gene expression in Aβ-associated microglia between different treatment groups (e.g., AN1792 vs. nAD, lecanemab vs. nAD), ST can identify upregulated genes specific to each condition [1]. For example, *FAM107A* was uniquely increased in Mg-2 and Mg-4 Aβ-associated ST spots in AN1792 samples, while *SPP1* and *LIPA* were associated only with lecanemab treatment [1]. *APOE* and *TREM2* were common responsive genes in both treatments [1].

*   **High-Definition ST:** High-definition ST can provide single-cell resolution, allowing for the mapping of nuclei to Aβ plaques using immunofluorescence staining [1]. Differential expression analysis can then confirm increased expression of specific genes (e.g., *SPP1*, *APOE*) in microglia near Aβ plaques after specific treatments [1].

*   **Cell-Cell Signaling:** ST data can be used to map cell-to-cell signaling pathways related to *APOE*, complement, and *SPP1*, revealing increased microglial signaling via complement and *SPP1* pathways in lecanemab-treated brains and elevated *APOE* signaling in both lecanemab and AN1792 samples [1].

*   **Regional Variability:** ST can reveal regional variability in microglial transcriptomic signatures [3]. For example, most changes in microglial gene expression in the lecanemab case were observed in the TCX and PCX, the two regions with the most Aβ clearance [3].

By analyzing these spatial gene expression patterns, researchers can distinguish between microglial activation states driven by local Aβ burden (reflected in the expression of genes related to Aβ processing and clearance) and those driven by systemic immune signaling (reflected in the expression of genes related to inflammation and immune response) [1, 3].",1.0,0.8292928363660629,8,gemini-2.0-flash

These anti-inflammatory dietary patterns may protect against cognitive decline [9, 11].",16,Which two specific dietary patterns are mentioned as potentially neuroprotective?,"[""To identify DEGs across various regions of interest within our datasets, we used two distinct differential expression techniques: DESeq2 (ref. 56) and MAST 29 . Each approach was adapted to suit the specific characteristics and requirements of the comparison, considering the nature of the data (pseudobulk for DESeq2 and single-cell method for MAST) and the level at which covariates were standardized (sample level for DESeq2 and ST spot or cell level for MAST). Covariate selection was guided by variance partition analysis, which identified gDNA as the primary driver of variance after the experimental group. Additionally, we accounted for the number of genes expressed in a subset of ST spots or cells to control for differences in quality and sequencing depth. Sex and age were included due to their known effects on immune responses in AD. Additionally, manually annotated regions or cortical layer annotations per ST spot were incorporated where applicable to address sampling variability across anatomical areas.\n\nDESeq2 . DESeq2 was initiated by subsetting the data for ST spots within the region of interest (ROI). Continuous covariates at the sample level, including age, average nFeatures within subsampled ST spots and gDNA percentage, were standardized within each ROI. We then filtered out genes not expressed in at least 1% of either comparison group based on raw counts, excluding genes starting with RPS, RPL, MT or HB. Pseudobulk data were created by summing raw counts by\n\ndonor to facilitate a more robust differential expression analysis. The DESeq2 analysis was conducted with the inclusion of covariates such as sex, age, average features within subsampled ST spots and gDNA percentage, all of which were standardized, if continuous. The DESeq function was run with fitType = 'local' to estimate dispersions using local regression, the results function was run with independentFiltering = FALSE to include low-expression genes in statistical testing, and LFC shrinkage was performed by running lfcShrink with type = 'apeglm'. P values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. DEG significance thresholds were set at an adjusted P value of 0.05 and a log2 fold change of ±log 2 (1.5).\n\nMAST . For MAST, data were subsetted to include only the ST spots or cells of interest. Sample-specific and brain region-specific downsampling was applied to ensure that no single sample contributed more than 50% of ST spots or cells within a comparison group, that the fold difference in total ST spots or cells between comparison groups did not exceed three, and that each group contained no more than 3,000 ST spots or cells. Continuous covariates at the ST spot level, including age, the CDR from recorrected SCT data and gDNA percentage per sample, were standardized within each subset of ST spots or cells. We applied PrepSCTFindMarkers on the ROI, which recorrects SCTransform counts to normalize sequencing depth across samples. SCT data (log1p-transformed SCT counts) were then extracted from the Seurat object. Genes prefixed with RPS, RPL, MT or HB were excluded, and additional filtering was performed based on percentage expression within comparison groups. Genes were tested if they were expressed in 1% of both groups and in 10% of either group using SCT expression data, except for Visium HD data, where genes were tested if they were expressed in 1% of either group. The log 2 fold change between comparison groups for the remaining genes was calculated using the Seurat FoldChange function. MAST was run with covariates such as sex, age, CDR, gDNA percentage, brain region and manually annotated regions or cortical layers, all of which were standardized if continuous. Sample ID, or brain region and sample ID, was included as a random effect for comparisons involving multiple samples. MAST hurdle P values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. LFC from the prior calculation was appended to the results, with significance thresholds for differential expression set at an adjusted P value of 0.05 and a LFC of ±log 2 (1.5)."", ""Candesartan is in phase 2 of clinical trials for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The study design is randomized having quadruple masking with parallel assignment model. The estimated enrollment for the study is of 77 participants. The recruitment status of the study is completed. Candesartan being an angiotensin receptor blocker has a potential to prevent the AT2R binding. Stress stimuli such as cold, predator exposure activate release of RAS and Ang II. In familial AD mice models candesartan reduced nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase levels. It also reduced the hyperactivation of microglia in the hippocampal region of AD mice brains (Torika et\xa0al. 2018). Candesartan potentially decrease the activity of angiotensin I receptor which contributes in the modulation of inflammation in AD (Trofimiuk et\xa0al. 2018).\n\n|   S.

CRID3 (or CP-456773, MCC950) is a specific, commercially available inhibitor  of  NLRP3.  Interestingly,  it  was  known  for  many  years  that CRID3  could  block  IL-1 β ,  but  it  was  only  in  2015  that  CRID3  was identified  as  a  specific  NLRP3  inflammasome  inhibitor  (Coll  et  al., 2015). We now understand that CRID3 acts within the NACHT domain of NLRP3 to prevent its activity (Coll et al., 2019). Using cryo-electron microscopy,  Hochheiser  and  colleagues  recently  demonstrated  that CRID3  binds  into  a  specific  cleft  within  NLRP3,  that  connects  four NACHT subdomains with an LRR transition segment. Having unravelled the precise site of action of CRID3, this will undoubtedly facilitate the design of better, more potent inhibitors moving forward (Hochheiser et al., 2022a). While CRID3 has been used in clinical trials, it has high plasma protein binding (Primiano et al., 2016) and it unfortunately can induce liver toxicity in humans at higher concentrations (Torres et al., 2021; Mangan et al., 2018; Cross, 2020). This makes the compound ideal for mechanistic studies in vitro and in vivo ,  but obviously less so as a therapy for patients.\n\nIn terms of AD, CRID3 effectively blocked the A β (Lu ˇ ci ¯ unait ˙ e et al., 2020; McManus et al., 2022; Dempsey et al., 2017) or Tau (Ising et al., 2019; Stancu et al., 2019)-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro , preventing cleavage and release of caspase-1 and IL-1 β . In animal models, CRID3 could prevent the production of IL-1 β , reduced A β deposition and rescued memory impairments in the APP/PS1 model of AD (Dempsey et al., 2017). CRID3 also reduced Tau seeding in the P301S model  of  Tauopathy,  and  attenuated  the  Tau-induced  microgliosis (Stancu et al., 2019).\n\nThere  are  a  number  of  other  NLRP3  inflammasome  inhibitors  at various  stages  of  pre-clinical  (IFM-514  (Torres  et  al.,  2021),  CY-09 (Wang  et  al.,  2021))  or  clinical  trials  such  as  DFV890  (IFM-2427) (Madurka  et  al.,  2023),  OLT1177  (Marchetti  et  al.,  2018),  Tranilast (Huang et al., 2018), Oridonin (He et al., 2018), Selnoflast (McFarthing et al., 2023) or Inzomelid (IZD174) (Coll et al., 2022), see Table 1 for details.

OLT1177 reduces the ATPase activity of NLRP3, it  likely  binds  to that region (Marchetti et al., 2018). A recent study found  that  OLT1177  does  not  directly  bind  to  NLRP3  (Teske  et  al., 2024), however, this does not detract from the effectiveness of OLT1177 at preventing the release of active IL-1 β (Marchetti et al., 2018; Tengesdal et al., 2021; Oizumi et al., 2022; Lonnemann et al., 2020) and the promising  findings  from  the  ongoing  clinical  trials  (Table  1).  The structures of most of the compounds are not yet publicly available, thus it is unknown where they precisely bind to prevent NLRP3 inflammasome signalling. However, as some of these inhibitors are in clinical trials for those with Parkinson ' s disease or ALS (Selnoflast and ZYIL1) and  many  compounds are  additionally  BBB  penetrant  (Table  1),  the results of these trials will be of interest to many with strong implications for future treatments of AD."", ""| 25HC   | 25-hydroxycholesterol            |\n|--------|----------------------------------|\n| AOF    | Alpinae Oxyphyllae Fructus       |\n| AD     | Alzheimer's disease              |\n| Aβ     | Amyloid beta                     |\n| APP    | Amyloid precursor protein        |\n| APOE   | polipoprotein E                  |\n| AA     | Arachidonic acid                 |\n| AhR    | Aryl hydrocarbon receptor        |\n| ABCA1  | ATP-binding cassette A1          |\n| ABCA7  | ATP-binding cassette A7          |\n| ABCA   | ATP-binding cassette subfamily A |\n\nBAs\n\nBile acids\n\nBBB\n\nBlood-brain barrier\n\nCRL\n\nCandida rugosa lipase\n\nCer\n\nCeramide\n\nCSF\n\nCerebrospinal fluid\n\nCDCA\n\nChenodeoxycholic acid\n\nCHOL\n\nCholesterol\n\nACAT\n\nCholesterol acyltransferase\n\nCE\n\nCholesterol ester\n\nCH25H\n\nCholesterol-25-hydroxylase\n\nCA\n\nCholic acid\n\nUDCA\n\nCholic ursodeoxycholic acid\n\nCLU\n\nClusterin\n\nDCA\n\nDeoxycholic acid\n\nDHA\n\nDocosahexaenoic acid\n\nEPA\n\nEicosapentaenoic acid\n\nPlsEtns\n\nEthanolamine plasmalogens\n\nePtdSer\n\nExternalized phosphatidylserine\n\nFXR\n\nFarnesoid X receptor\n\nFAs\n\nFatty acids\n\nFMT\n\nFecal microbiota transplantation\n\nFFA\n\nFree fatty acid\n\nGPBAR1/TGR5\n\nG protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein- coupled receptor 5\n\nGPRs\n\nG protein-coupled receptors\n\nGWAS\n\nGenome-wide association studies\n\nGSK3β\n\nGlycogen synthase kinase 3 beta\n\nGM\n\nGut microbiota\n\nGPCRs\n\nG-protein coupled receptors\n\nGF\n\nGerm-free\n\nHF\n\nHawthorn flavonoid\n\nHATs\n\nHistone acetyltransferases\n\nHDACs\n\nHistone deacetylases\n\nIPAM\n\nIndole-3-propionamide\n\nIPA\n\nIndole-3-propionic acid\n\nIL-1β\n\nInterleukin-1 beta\n\nLOAD\n\nLate-onset Alzheimer's disease\n\nLRP1\n\nLDLR-related protein 1\n\nLPS\n\nLipopolysaccharides\n\nLCA\n\nLithocholic acid\n\nLDLR\n\nLow-density lipoprotein receptor\n\nLRP-1\n\nLow-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1\n\nMCI\n\nMild Cognitive Impairment\n\nMMKD\n\nModified Mediterranean-Ketogenic Diet\n\nCML\n\nN6-carboxymethyllysine\n\nNDAN\n\nNondemented individuals with AD neuropathology\n\nNFTs\n\nNeurofibrillary tangles\n\nNLRP3\n\nNOD-like receptor protein 3\n\nNF-κB\n\nNuclear factor kappa B\n\nPA\n\nPalmitic acid\n\nPGE2\n\nProstaglandin E2\n\nPGF1α\n\nProstaglandin f1alpha\n\nPGF2α\n\nProstaglandin F2alpha\n\nPC\n\nPhosphatidylcholine\n\nPE\n\nPhosphatidylethanolamine\n\nPUFAs\n\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids\n\nPtdSer\n\nPhosphatidylserine\n\nRA\n\nRetinoic acid\n\nRNS\n\nReactive nitrogen species\n\nROS\n\nReactive oxygen species\n\nSFAs\n\nSaturated fatty acids\n\nSCFAs\n\nShort-chain fatty acids\n\nS1P\n\nSphingosine-1-phosphate\n\nSPF\n\nSpecific pathogen-free\n\nSREBPs\n\nSterol regulatory-element binding proteins\n\nTUDCA\n\nTauroursodeoxycholic acid\n\nTLRs\n\nToll-like receptors\n\nTLR4\n\nToll-like receptor 4\n\nTCA\n\nTricarboxylic acid\n\nTREM2\n\nTriggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2\n\nTMA\n\nTrimethylamine\n\nTMAO\n\nTrimethylamine N-oxide\n\nTRP\n\nTryptophan\n\nTRYCATs\n\nTryptophan catabolites\n\nTNFα\n\nTumor necrosis factor alpha\n\nUFAs\n\nUnsaturated fatty acids\n\nBACE1\n\nβ-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1\n\nω-3 PUFAs\n\nω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids\n\nω-6 PUFAs\n\nω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids"", 'Community 0: Contains concepts [""Alzheimer\'s disease"", \'heightened immune response\']...', 'Community 3: Contains concepts [\'Nrf2\', \'NF-kB\', ""Alzheimer\'s Disease"", \'JAK/STAT\', \'Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway\']...', ""Community 5: Contains concepts ['GSK3β signaling', 'pathophysiology of AD']..."", 'Given the lack of effective treatments and projected increased prevalence of AD, there is considerable interest in understanding the contribution of neuroinflammation to the pathogenesis of AD in order to develop effective preventive strategies for cognitive decline.\n\nCompelling evidence shows that nutrients and other bioactive dietary compounds influence neuroinflammatory processes leading to neurodegeneration in animals and that nutrients can act synergistically to exert greater biological effects. It is plausible that diets rich in anti-inflammatory components attenuate neuroinflammation via several immune pathways within the brain and indirectly from the gut microbiome and systemic circulation. However, data from human studies are lacking and the exact inflammatory mechanisms linking diet to cognitive function remain elusive.\n\nGrowing evidence supports a protective effect of antiinflammatory dietary patterns, especially the MD, against cognitive decline in older persons but causal associations between diet and AD remain uncertain. The evidence base has been recently strengthened by small intervention studies showing improvements in cognitive function in response to MD and calorie-controlled DASH. However, adequately powered intervention studies with larger sample sizes and longer durations are required to examine the effect of dietary modification on clinically relevant cognitive outcomes. Neuroimaging studies have shown direct beneficial associations of MD on preclinical changes associated with AD; therefore, brain biomarkers should be considered as end-points in future intervention studies to investigate diet-associated neurological change from the earliest through to latest stages of cognitive decline. Furthermore, incorporation of PET (positron emission tomography) could allow measurement of in vivo microglia activation [102] and advance current understanding of the mechanistic effects of dietary modification on neuroinflammation in the ageing brain.\n\nWhile most research attention has been given to MD and DASH,there is still much to learn about the ideal combination of foods and nutrients for optimal cognitive health during ageing. More recently, the MIND (Mediterranean-DASH diet intervention for neurodegeneration delay) dietary pattern that incorporates foods based on evidence in the diet-dementia field has shown to be more predictive of cognitive decline than the MD [103] and has also been associated with reduced AD risk [104]. The effect of MIND on cognitive decline is currently being evaluated in several US trials (e.g. clinicaltrials.gov Reference NCT02817074, NCT03688126) and will generate valuable data to determine whether improving diet quality is an effective strategy to improve brain health in older adults.\n\nFunding This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust [Grant Ref 202097/Z/16/Z].', ""Worldwide, 50 million people are living with Alzheimer ' s disease (AD) and related dementias, and this figure is projected to triple by 2050 unless preventive measures are developed [1]. Addressing modifiable risk factors is considered to be the most promising strategy to prevent AD [1]. In this regard, increasing evidence suggests that dietary interventions have potential to protect against cognitive decline during ageing [2 -4].\n\nThis article is part of the Topical Collection on Nutrition and Aging\n\n* Claire T. McEvoy c.mcevoy@qub.ac.uk\n\n1 Institute of Health and Society and Newcastle University Institute of Ageing, Newcastle University, Biomedical Research Building, Campus of Ageing and Vitality, Newcastle upon Tyne NE4 5PL, UK\n\n2 Centre for Public Health, Queen ' s University Belfast, Grosvenor Road, Belfast, Northern Ireland BT12 6BJ, UK\n\nThe mechanisms governing dietary influences on cognition are not clear, but inflammatory pathways are likely to be involved [5, 6]. Inflammation has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of AD [7 ·· , 8]. Microglial macrophages in the brain become chronically activated during ageing [9], and particularly under pathological conditions [10], to promote sustained production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1 β , interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factorα (TNFα ) [8, 11]. Production of these molecules can perpetuate a cycle of neuroinflammatory processes including amyloidosis, neuronal death [10, 12], cortical thinning [13, 14], reduced brain volume [13], cerebral vascular diseaserelated events such as microbleeds and infarcts [15, 16] and neurodegeneration [7 ·· ]. Genetic studies provide strong evidence for a causative role of neuroinflammation in AD, with several mutations in microglial genes, for example, TREM2 and CD33, being independently associated with elevated AD risk [17]. Furthermore, greater numbers of activated microglial cells and cytokines have been confirmed in brain tissue from individuals with AD [18].\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDiet is known to modulate the immune system [19 ·· ], and several nutrients and bioactive components can influence neuroinflammatory processes in animals. For example, polyphenols, unsaturated fats and antioxidant vitamins inhibit oxidative stress and neuroinflammation [20, 21 ·· , 22], while saturated fat promotes inflammation, particularly in the hypothalamus [23]. However, it is not clear whether diet-induced effects on neurocognition are mediated directly by neuroinflammatory processes and/or via other immune mechanisms in vivo. An increasing body of evidence suggests that peripheral inflammation and alterations to the gut microbiome can amplify neuroinflammation and accelerate neurodegeneration [7 ·· , 24, 25] and these external factors can also be influenced by diet [26].\n\nMechanistic studies in the brain have primarily focused on single nutrients. However, the synergistic effects of nutrients and foods when consumed together as a usual dietary pattern are likely to exert greater effects on inflammatory processes and neurodegeneration during ageing [25, 27]. There has been much interest in examining the Mediterranean diet (MD) and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) dietary patterns as potential strategies for dementia prevention due to their proven anti-inflammatory [28 -30] and cardioprotective effects [31, 32]. The MD and DASH have shown promising associations with slower rate of cognitive decline [33, 34] and reduced AD risk [35 -38] although results have not been consistent [39, 40] and evidence for a causal relationship is limited due to the small number of diet intervention studies conducted. Interestingly, more recent neuroimaging studies have shown protective effects of MD on neuronal structures and early morphological changes linked to neurodegeneration and AD [41 -48].\n\nThis review aims to summarise available evidence to evaluate the role of MD and DASH dietary patterns for cognitive health and AD risk during ageing and discuss underlying inflammatory mechanisms of diet on cognitive function in humans and animal models."", ""Purpose of Review Nutrition is known to modulate the immune system and may alter neuroinflammatory processes implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer ' s disease (AD) and progression of neurodegeneration. Here, we review the evidence for healthy dietary patterns and age-related cognition and discuss potential neuroinflammatory actions of diet on cognitive function.\n\nRecent Findings Anti-inflammatory dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet (MD) and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) may be neuroprotective. Several dietary components consumed in the MD and DASH (omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants and polyphenols) can inhibit neuroinflammation associated with AD. Anti-inflammatory diets may also attenuate neuroinflammation via indirect immune pathways from the gut microbiome and systemic circulation.\n\nSummary Diet may influence cognitive ageing via several inflammatory pathways. However, data from human studies are lacking and the exact mechanisms linking diet to cognitive function remain elusive. Further dietary intervention studies are required to investigate diet-associated neurological change from the earliest through to latest stages of cognitive decline. Furthermore, incorporation of neuroimaging measures in intervention studies would advance current understanding of the mechanistic effects of dietary modification on neuroinflammation in the ageing brain.\n\nKeywords Inflammation .

Adherence to the MD has demonstrated clear benefits for both primary [32] and secondary [51] CVD prevention. This may also be the case for cognitive function. A recent pooled analysis of available\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprospective data in older adults reported a beneficial association between adherence to the MD and cognitive function, especially for domains of global cognition and episodic memory [52].\n\nObservational studies that have evaluated the MD for cognitive health are summarised in Table 1. In summary, greater concordance to the MD has been associated with better cognitive performance [53, 54, 57, 58, 65], slower rate of cognitive decline [61, 66 -68] and reduced risk of cognitive impairment [53, 55, 56, 61] and AD [36]. However, the variable and sometimes disparate study findings [27, 59, 60, 62 -64] are likely due to differences between studies in the populations investigated and methods used to assess diet and cognition. Most epidemiologic studies have examined MD adherence using a score system derived from population-specific median reported intake thresholds for each individual food component in the MD score and this approach limits the comparability of findings with other populations [53]. Furthermore, there is heterogeneity between studies with regards to the cognitive outcomes measured, follow-up time and population characteristics including baseline cognitive status.\n\nIt is possible that MD contributes to neuronal integrity across the life-course. Emerging evidence from observational studies report a link between greater MD adherence and more favourable brain structures and functions that protect against neurodegeneration including increased cortical thickness [45, 48], greater brain volumes [42], slower rate of hippocampal atrophy and improved structural connectivity [43, 44, 46] as well as less amyloid (A β ) accumulation at both midlife and older age [41, 47].\n\nThe effect of MD on neurocognition has been evaluated in a limited number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The PREDIMED study demonstrated a modest beneficial effect of increased MD adherence over 4 -6 years on cognitive function in cognitively healthy adults at high CVD risk [2, 4, 71] particularly in domains of global cognition, memory and executive function [4]. In contrast, adopting a MD over 6 months had no effect on cognitive function in healthy older Australian adults [72]. The recent NU-AGE trial also reported no benefit of a Mediterranean-style diet on cognitive function after 1 year in older European adults; however, participants with greatest MD adherence demonstrated improved global cognition and episodic memory compared to those with low adherence [73].', 'Community 0: Contains concepts [""Alzheimer\'s disease"", \'heightened immune response\']...', 'Community 3: Contains concepts [\'Nrf2\', \'NF-kB\', ""Alzheimer\'s Disease"", \'JAK/STAT\', \'Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway\']...', ""Community 5: Contains concepts ['GSK3β signaling', 'pathophysiology of AD']...""]","The Mediterranean diet (MD) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) are two specific dietary patterns mentioned as potentially neuroprotective [11].

Here, we review the evidence for healthy dietary patterns and age-related cognition and discuss potential neuroinflammatory actions of diet on cognitive function.\n\nRecent Findings Anti-inflammatory dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet (MD) and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) may be neuroprotective. Several dietary components consumed in the MD and DASH (omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants and polyphenols) can inhibit neuroinflammation associated with AD. Anti-inflammatory diets may also attenuate neuroinflammation via indirect immune pathways from the gut microbiome and systemic circulation.\n\nSummary Diet may influence cognitive ageing via several inflammatory pathways. However, data from human studies are lacking and the exact mechanisms linking diet to cognitive function remain elusive. Further dietary intervention studies are required to investigate diet-associated neurological change from the earliest through to latest stages of cognitive decline.

Cognitive ageing . Alzheimer ' s disease"", ""Worldwide, 50 million people are living with Alzheimer ' s disease (AD) and related dementias, and this figure is projected to triple by 2050 unless preventive measures are developed [1]. Addressing modifiable risk factors is considered to be the most promising strategy to prevent AD [1]. In this regard, increasing evidence suggests that dietary interventions have potential to protect against cognitive decline during ageing [2 -4].\n\nThis article is part of the Topical Collection on Nutrition and Aging\n\n* Claire T. McEvoy c.mcevoy@qub.ac.uk\n\n1 Institute of Health and Society and Newcastle University Institute of Ageing, Newcastle University, Biomedical Research Building, Campus of Ageing and Vitality, Newcastle upon Tyne NE4 5PL, UK\n\n2 Centre for Public Health, Queen ' s University Belfast, Grosvenor Road, Belfast, Northern Ireland BT12 6BJ, UK\n\nThe mechanisms governing dietary influences on cognition are not clear, but inflammatory pathways are likely to be involved [5, 6]. Inflammation has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of AD [7 ·· , 8]. Microglial macrophages in the brain become chronically activated during ageing [9], and particularly under pathological conditions [10], to promote sustained production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1 β , interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factorα (TNFα ) [8, 11]. Production of these molecules can perpetuate a cycle of neuroinflammatory processes including amyloidosis, neuronal death [10, 12], cortical thinning [13, 14], reduced brain volume [13], cerebral vascular diseaserelated events such as microbleeds and infarcts [15, 16] and neurodegeneration [7 ·· ]. Genetic studies provide strong evidence for a causative role of neuroinflammation in AD, with several mutations in microglial genes, for example, TREM2 and CD33, being independently associated with elevated AD risk [17]. Furthermore, greater numbers of activated microglial cells and cytokines have been confirmed in brain tissue from individuals with AD [18].\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDiet is known to modulate the immune system [19 ·· ], and several nutrients and bioactive components can influence neuroinflammatory processes in animals. For example, polyphenols, unsaturated fats and antioxidant vitamins inhibit oxidative stress and neuroinflammation [20, 21 ·· , 22], while saturated fat promotes inflammation, particularly in the hypothalamus [23]. However, it is not clear whether diet-induced effects on neurocognition are mediated directly by neuroinflammatory processes and/or via other immune mechanisms in vivo. An increasing body of evidence suggests that peripheral inflammation and alterations to the gut microbiome can amplify neuroinflammation and accelerate neurodegeneration [7 ·· , 24, 25] and these external factors can also be influenced by diet [26].\n\nMechanistic studies in the brain have primarily focused on single nutrients. However, the synergistic effects of nutrients and foods when consumed together as a usual dietary pattern are likely to exert greater effects on inflammatory processes and neurodegeneration during ageing [25, 27]. There has been much interest in examining the Mediterranean diet (MD) and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) dietary patterns as potential strategies for dementia prevention due to their proven anti-inflammatory [28 -30] and cardioprotective effects [31, 32]. The MD and DASH have shown promising associations with slower rate of cognitive decline [33, 34] and reduced AD risk [35 -38] although results have not been consistent [39, 40] and evidence for a causal relationship is limited due to the small number of diet intervention studies conducted. Interestingly, more recent neuroimaging studies have shown protective effects of MD on neuronal structures and early morphological changes linked to neurodegeneration and AD [41 -48].\n\nThis review aims to summarise available evidence to evaluate the role of MD and DASH dietary patterns for cognitive health and AD risk during ageing and discuss underlying inflammatory mechanisms of diet on cognitive function in humans and animal models."", 'Given the lack of effective treatments and projected increased prevalence of AD, there is considerable interest in understanding the contribution of neuroinflammation to the pathogenesis of AD in order to develop effective preventive strategies for cognitive decline.\n\nCompelling evidence shows that nutrients and other bioactive dietary compounds influence neuroinflammatory processes leading to neurodegeneration in animals and that nutrients can act synergistically to exert greater biological effects. It is plausible that diets rich in anti-inflammatory components attenuate neuroinflammation via several immune pathways within the brain and indirectly from the gut microbiome and systemic circulation. However, data from human studies are lacking and the exact inflammatory mechanisms linking diet to cognitive function remain elusive.\n\nGrowing evidence supports a protective effect of antiinflammatory dietary patterns, especially the MD, against cognitive decline in older persons but causal associations between diet and AD remain uncertain. The evidence base has been recently strengthened by small intervention studies showing improvements in cognitive function in response to MD and calorie-controlled DASH. However, adequately powered intervention studies with larger sample sizes and longer durations are required to examine the effect of dietary modification on clinically relevant cognitive outcomes. Neuroimaging studies have shown direct beneficial associations of MD on preclinical changes associated with AD; therefore, brain biomarkers should be considered as end-points in future intervention studies to investigate diet-associated neurological change from the earliest through to latest stages of cognitive decline. Furthermore, incorporation of PET (positron emission tomography) could allow measurement of in vivo microglia activation [102] and advance current understanding of the mechanistic effects of dietary modification on neuroinflammation in the ageing brain.\n\nWhile most research attention has been given to MD and DASH,there is still much to learn about the ideal combination of foods and nutrients for optimal cognitive health during ageing. More recently, the MIND (Mediterranean-DASH diet intervention for neurodegeneration delay) dietary pattern that incorporates foods based on evidence in the diet-dementia field has shown to be more predictive of cognitive decline than the MD [103] and has also been associated with reduced AD risk [104]. The effect of MIND on cognitive decline is currently being evaluated in several US trials (e.g. clinicaltrials.gov Reference NCT02817074, NCT03688126) and will generate valuable data to determine whether improving diet quality is an effective strategy to improve brain health in older adults.\n\nFunding This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust [Grant Ref 202097/Z/16/Z].', 'The MD describes the traditional dietary pattern consumed in Mediterranean countries and is characterised by high intake of fruits, vegetables, wholegrains, nuts and legumes; moderate intake of fish, poultry and alcohol (particularly red wine, with meals) and low intake of red and processed meats with olive oil used as the main fat source [49, 50]. Adherence to the MD has demonstrated clear benefits for both primary [32] and secondary [51] CVD prevention. This may also be the case for cognitive function. A recent pooled analysis of available\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprospective data in older adults reported a beneficial association between adherence to the MD and cognitive function, especially for domains of global cognition and episodic memory [52].\n\nObservational studies that have evaluated the MD for cognitive health are summarised in Table 1. In summary, greater concordance to the MD has been associated with better cognitive performance [53, 54, 57, 58, 65], slower rate of cognitive decline [61, 66 -68] and reduced risk of cognitive impairment [53, 55, 56, 61] and AD [36]. However, the variable and sometimes disparate study findings [27, 59, 60, 62 -64] are likely due to differences between studies in the populations investigated and methods used to assess diet and cognition. Most epidemiologic studies have examined MD adherence using a score system derived from population-specific median reported intake thresholds for each individual food component in the MD score and this approach limits the comparability of findings with other populations [53]. Furthermore, there is heterogeneity between studies with regards to the cognitive outcomes measured, follow-up time and population characteristics including baseline cognitive status.\n\nIt is possible that MD contributes to neuronal integrity across the life-course. Emerging evidence from observational studies report a link between greater MD adherence and more favourable brain structures and functions that protect against neurodegeneration including increased cortical thickness [45, 48], greater brain volumes [42], slower rate of hippocampal atrophy and improved structural connectivity [43, 44, 46] as well as less amyloid (A β ) accumulation at both midlife and older age [41, 47].\n\nThe effect of MD on neurocognition has been evaluated in a limited number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The PREDIMED study demonstrated a modest beneficial effect of increased MD adherence over 4 -6 years on cognitive function in cognitively healthy adults at high CVD risk [2, 4, 71] particularly in domains of global cognition, memory and executive function [4]. In contrast, adopting a MD over 6 months had no effect on cognitive function in healthy older Australian adults [72]. The recent NU-AGE trial also reported no benefit of a Mediterranean-style diet on cognitive function after 1 year in older European adults; however, participants with greatest MD adherence demonstrated improved global cognition and episodic memory compared to those with low adherence [73].', 'Nutrients have important physiological roles for normal brain functioning and are transported into the brain via the blood -brain barrier (BBB) or from the choroid plexus transport locus of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier by distinct mechanisms, such as facilitated diffusion and active transport [76]. The effect of whole dietary patterns on neuroinflammation is yet to be discerned; however, animal studies have consistently reported anti-neuroinflammatory effects of several nutrients typically eaten in high amounts in MD and DASH diets.\n\nAntioxidants from fruit and vegetables suppress neuroinflammatory processes and neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting free radicals and cytokine production in activated microglia cells [22, 75, 77] and plant-derived flavonoids are thought to play a role in preventing neuroinflammation by downregulating transcription factor activity, e.g. NF-KB and inhibiting pro-inflammatory cell signalling pathways [78, 79]. Long chain omega-3 fatty acids from fish attenuate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in microglia and help to resolve inflammation in the brain [20, 80].\n\nWhile these animal studies provide important insights into mechanistic actions of diet on neuroinflammation, it is not clear how well the findings translate to humans, due to potential differences in nutrient bioavailability and metabolism. Indeed, single nutrient supplementation has shown no cognitive benefit among older adults in the few trials that have been conducted so far [81 · , 82 · ], although positive signals have been observed for individuals with low baseline nutrient status [83] and for fish oil supplementation in early cognitive impairment [84], suggesting that population subgroups may derive cognitive benefit from nutrient supplementation.', 'Community 0: Contains concepts [""Alzheimer\'s disease"", \'heightened immune response\']...', 'Community 3: Contains concepts [\'Nrf2\', \'NF-kB\', ""Alzheimer\'s Disease"", \'JAK/STAT\', \'Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway\']...', ""Community 5: Contains concepts ['GSK3β signaling', 'pathophysiology of AD']...""]","The Mediterranean diet (MD) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) are two specific dietary patterns mentioned as potentially neuroprotective [1, 2].",1.0,0.8264542597477407,8,gemini-2.0-flash

There is limited evidence from intervention studies for an effect of DASH on neurocognition. The ENCORE study showed improved cognitive function in response to a calorie restricted DASH diet among overweight adults with hypertension [3], while preliminary 6-month data from the ENLIGHTEN study in cognitively impaired adults demonstrated no benefit of DASH diet alone on cognition, but improvement in executive function among those consuming DASH combined with aerobic exercise [74].\n\nCollectively, the available evidence suggests that MD and DASH patterns may provide protection against neurodegeneration during ageing, with more consistent associations in favour of the MD, probably owing to a greater number of studies that have examined MD and cognition, relative to DASH or indeed other dietary patterns. Further prospective studies in diverse populations are recommended to determine relations between dietary patterns and clinically relevant measures of cognitive decline as well as incident AD. While few dietary intervention studies have been conducted, beneficial effects of MD on cognition are shown in trials of longer duration (12 months or more) [2, 4, 60] and in participants who adhere more closely to the intervention diet [63]. Further research is required to determine the duration of dietary intervention needed for optimal effect on cognition and to identify cognitive end-point measures that can respond to subtle dietinduced changes in the ageing brain. Furthermore, intervention strategies would benefit from learning how best to support behaviour change towards a healthy dietary pattern in different population groups.\n\nThe MD and DASH dietary patterns are typically low in saturated fat, sugar and high in antioxidants, fibres and polyphenols, which have potential independent effects on brain health. It is likely that the myriad of bioactive compounds and nutrients consumed at synergistic levels within these dietary patterns exert the potential to reduce neuroinflammatory processes involved in neurodegeneration [75]."", ""Worldwide, 50 million people are living with Alzheimer ' s disease (AD) and related dementias, and this figure is projected to triple by 2050 unless preventive measures are developed [1]. Addressing modifiable risk factors is considered to be the most promising strategy to prevent AD [1]. In this regard, increasing evidence suggests that dietary interventions have potential to protect against cognitive decline during ageing [2 -4].\n\nThis article is part of the Topical Collection on Nutrition and Aging\n\n* Claire T.

Inflammation has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of AD [7 ·· , 8]. Microglial macrophages in the brain become chronically activated during ageing [9], and particularly under pathological conditions [10], to promote sustained production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1 β , interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factorα (TNFα ) [8, 11]. Production of these molecules can perpetuate a cycle of neuroinflammatory processes including amyloidosis, neuronal death [10, 12], cortical thinning [13, 14], reduced brain volume [13], cerebral vascular diseaserelated events such as microbleeds and infarcts [15, 16] and neurodegeneration [7 ·· ]. Genetic studies provide strong evidence for a causative role of neuroinflammation in AD, with several mutations in microglial genes, for example, TREM2 and CD33, being independently associated with elevated AD risk [17]. Furthermore, greater numbers of activated microglial cells and cytokines have been confirmed in brain tissue from individuals with AD [18].\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDiet is known to modulate the immune system [19 ·· ], and several nutrients and bioactive components can influence neuroinflammatory processes in animals. For example, polyphenols, unsaturated fats and antioxidant vitamins inhibit oxidative stress and neuroinflammation [20, 21 ·· , 22], while saturated fat promotes inflammation, particularly in the hypothalamus [23]. However, it is not clear whether diet-induced effects on neurocognition are mediated directly by neuroinflammatory processes and/or via other immune mechanisms in vivo. An increasing body of evidence suggests that peripheral inflammation and alterations to the gut microbiome can amplify neuroinflammation and accelerate neurodegeneration [7 ·· , 24, 25] and these external factors can also be influenced by diet [26].\n\nMechanistic studies in the brain have primarily focused on single nutrients. However, the synergistic effects of nutrients and foods when consumed together as a usual dietary pattern are likely to exert greater effects on inflammatory processes and neurodegeneration during ageing [25, 27]. There has been much interest in examining the Mediterranean diet (MD) and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) dietary patterns as potential strategies for dementia prevention due to their proven anti-inflammatory [28 -30] and cardioprotective effects [31, 32]. The MD and DASH have shown promising associations with slower rate of cognitive decline [33, 34] and reduced AD risk [35 -38] although results have not been consistent [39, 40] and evidence for a causal relationship is limited due to the small number of diet intervention studies conducted. Interestingly, more recent neuroimaging studies have shown protective effects of MD on neuronal structures and early morphological changes linked to neurodegeneration and AD [41 -48].\n\nThis review aims to summarise available evidence to evaluate the role of MD and DASH dietary patterns for cognitive health and AD risk during ageing and discuss underlying inflammatory mechanisms of diet on cognitive function in humans and animal models."", ""Purpose of Review Nutrition is known to modulate the immune system and may alter neuroinflammatory processes implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer ' s disease (AD) and progression of neurodegeneration. Here, we review the evidence for healthy dietary patterns and age-related cognition and discuss potential neuroinflammatory actions of diet on cognitive function.\n\nRecent Findings Anti-inflammatory dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet (MD) and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) may be neuroprotective. Several dietary components consumed in the MD and DASH (omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants and polyphenols) can inhibit neuroinflammation associated with AD. Anti-inflammatory diets may also attenuate neuroinflammation via indirect immune pathways from the gut microbiome and systemic circulation.\n\nSummary Diet may influence cognitive ageing via several inflammatory pathways. However, data from human studies are lacking and the exact mechanisms linking diet to cognitive function remain elusive. Further dietary intervention studies are required to investigate diet-associated neurological change from the earliest through to latest stages of cognitive decline. Furthermore, incorporation of neuroimaging measures in intervention studies would advance current understanding of the mechanistic effects of dietary modification on neuroinflammation in the ageing brain.\n\nKeywords Inflammation .

Cognitive ageing . Alzheimer ' s disease"", 'Increased peripheral inflammatory markers have been associated with neurodegeneration [85] and are suggested to increase neuroinflammation via neuronal and hormonal pathways, as previously reviewed [7 ·· , 19 ·· ]. The MD and DASH diet have demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects in humans. In a recent meta-analysis of six RCTs, DASH significantly decreased serum (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentration (mean difference -1.01: 95% CI -1.64, -0.38; I 2 = 67.7%) compared to usual diet which tended to be of greater magnitude in trials with longer duration [30]. The MD has been shown to decrease a broader range of inflammatory biomarkers. The PREDIMED study reported reductions in cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p70, CRP, TNFα ) and chemokines (MCP-1 and macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIP-1 β )) in response to a 3-month MD supplemented with either olive oil or nuts, and the anti-inflammatory effects were observed up to 5 years of intervention [28, 29]. Adoption of a MD also significantly reduced hs-CRP, IL-6, IL-7, and IL-18 in patients with the metabolic syndrome [86]. Furthermore, key components of the MD, such as oily fish and omega 3 fatty acids, as well as bioactive polyphenols found in fruits and vegetables, red wine and olive oil have also been shown to reduce pro-inflammatory markers [78, 87, 88 ·· ]. Hence, the ability of dietary patterns, particularly the MD, to decrease systemic inflammation may help to attenuate neuroinflammation.\n\nEmerging observational data lend support to systemic inflammation as a driver between diet and neurocognition (Table 2). High pro-inflammatory dietary scores have been linked with poor cognitive performance [91, 94] and cognitive impairment [92, 93]. Moreover, a proinflammatory dietary pattern, based on circulating IL-6 and characterised by higher intake of red meat, processed meat, peas and legumes, and fried food, and lower intake of whole grains has been associated with accelerated cognitive decline [89], while an inflammatory nutrient pattern derived from IL-6 and CRP levels and characterised by low intake of calcium, antioxidant vitamins, omega-3 and high intake of cholesterol, has been inversely associated with brain volume and cognitive function [90]. Further longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate whether dietary patterns based on systemic inflammatory biomarkers are related to incident AD.', 'The MD describes the traditional dietary pattern consumed in Mediterranean countries and is characterised by high intake of fruits, vegetables, wholegrains, nuts and legumes; moderate intake of fish, poultry and alcohol (particularly red wine, with meals) and low intake of red and processed meats with olive oil used as the main fat source [49, 50]. Adherence to the MD has demonstrated clear benefits for both primary [32] and secondary [51] CVD prevention. This may also be the case for cognitive function. A recent pooled analysis of available\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprospective data in older adults reported a beneficial association between adherence to the MD and cognitive function, especially for domains of global cognition and episodic memory [52].\n\nObservational studies that have evaluated the MD for cognitive health are summarised in Table 1. In summary, greater concordance to the MD has been associated with better cognitive performance [53, 54, 57, 58, 65], slower rate of cognitive decline [61, 66 -68] and reduced risk of cognitive impairment [53, 55, 56, 61] and AD [36]. However, the variable and sometimes disparate study findings [27, 59, 60, 62 -64] are likely due to differences between studies in the populations investigated and methods used to assess diet and cognition. Most epidemiologic studies have examined MD adherence using a score system derived from population-specific median reported intake thresholds for each individual food component in the MD score and this approach limits the comparability of findings with other populations [53]. Furthermore, there is heterogeneity between studies with regards to the cognitive outcomes measured, follow-up time and population characteristics including baseline cognitive status.\n\nIt is possible that MD contributes to neuronal integrity across the life-course. Emerging evidence from observational studies report a link between greater MD adherence and more favourable brain structures and functions that protect against neurodegeneration including increased cortical thickness [45, 48], greater brain volumes [42], slower rate of hippocampal atrophy and improved structural connectivity [43, 44, 46] as well as less amyloid (A β ) accumulation at both midlife and older age [41, 47].\n\nThe effect of MD on neurocognition has been evaluated in a limited number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The PREDIMED study demonstrated a modest beneficial effect of increased MD adherence over 4 -6 years on cognitive function in cognitively healthy adults at high CVD risk [2, 4, 71] particularly in domains of global cognition, memory and executive function [4]. In contrast, adopting a MD over 6 months had no effect on cognitive function in healthy older Australian adults [72]. The recent NU-AGE trial also reported no benefit of a Mediterranean-style diet on cognitive function after 1 year in older European adults; however, participants with greatest MD adherence demonstrated improved global cognition and episodic memory compared to those with low adherence [73].', 'Community 0: Contains concepts [""Alzheimer\'s disease"", \'heightened immune response\']...', 'Community 3: Contains concepts [\'Nrf2\', \'NF-kB\', ""Alzheimer\'s Disease"", \'JAK/STAT\', \'Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway\']...', ""Community 5: Contains concepts ['GSK3β signaling', 'pathophysiology of AD']...""]","According to the provided text, several dietary components consumed in the Mediterranean Diet (MD) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) can inhibit neuroinflammation associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

Each approach was adapted to suit the specific characteristics and requirements of the comparison, considering the nature of the data (pseudobulk for DESeq2 and single-cell method for MAST) and the level at which covariates were standardized (sample level for DESeq2 and ST spot or cell level for MAST). Covariate selection was guided by variance partition analysis, which identified gDNA as the primary driver of variance after the experimental group. Additionally, we accounted for the number of genes expressed in a subset of ST spots or cells to control for differences in quality and sequencing depth. Sex and age were included due to their known effects on immune responses in AD. Additionally, manually annotated regions or cortical layer annotations per ST spot were incorporated where applicable to address sampling variability across anatomical areas.\n\nDESeq2 . DESeq2 was initiated by subsetting the data for ST spots within the region of interest (ROI). Continuous covariates at the sample level, including age, average nFeatures within subsampled ST spots and gDNA percentage, were standardized within each ROI. We then filtered out genes not expressed in at least 1% of either comparison group based on raw counts, excluding genes starting with RPS, RPL, MT or HB. Pseudobulk data were created by summing raw counts by\n\ndonor to facilitate a more robust differential expression analysis. The DESeq2 analysis was conducted with the inclusion of covariates such as sex, age, average features within subsampled ST spots and gDNA percentage, all of which were standardized, if continuous. The DESeq function was run with fitType = 'local' to estimate dispersions using local regression, the results function was run with independentFiltering = FALSE to include low-expression genes in statistical testing, and LFC shrinkage was performed by running lfcShrink with type = 'apeglm'. P values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. DEG significance thresholds were set at an adjusted P value of 0.05 and a log2 fold change of ±log 2 (1.5).\n\nMAST . For MAST, data were subsetted to include only the ST spots or cells of interest. Sample-specific and brain region-specific downsampling was applied to ensure that no single sample contributed more than 50% of ST spots or cells within a comparison group, that the fold difference in total ST spots or cells between comparison groups did not exceed three, and that each group contained no more than 3,000 ST spots or cells. Continuous covariates at the ST spot level, including age, the CDR from recorrected SCT data and gDNA percentage per sample, were standardized within each subset of ST spots or cells. We applied PrepSCTFindMarkers on the ROI, which recorrects SCTransform counts to normalize sequencing depth across samples. SCT data (log1p-transformed SCT counts) were then extracted from the Seurat object. Genes prefixed with RPS, RPL, MT or HB were excluded, and additional filtering was performed based on percentage expression within comparison groups. Genes were tested if they were expressed in 1% of both groups and in 10% of either group using SCT expression data, except for Visium HD data, where genes were tested if they were expressed in 1% of either group. The log 2 fold change between comparison groups for the remaining genes was calculated using the Seurat FoldChange function. MAST was run with covariates such as sex, age, CDR, gDNA percentage, brain region and manually annotated regions or cortical layers, all of which were standardized if continuous. Sample ID, or brain region and sample ID, was included as a random effect for comparisons involving multiple samples. MAST hurdle P values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. LFC from the prior calculation was appended to the results, with significance thresholds for differential expression set at an adjusted P value of 0.05 and a LFC of ±log 2 (1.5)."", ""Candesartan is in phase 2 of clinical trials for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The study design is randomized having quadruple masking with parallel assignment model. The estimated enrollment for the study is of 77 participants. The recruitment status of the study is completed. Candesartan being an angiotensin receptor blocker has a potential to prevent the AT2R binding. Stress stimuli such as cold, predator exposure activate release of RAS and Ang II. In familial AD mice models candesartan reduced nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase levels. It also reduced the hyperactivation of microglia in the hippocampal region of AD mice brains (Torika et\xa0al. 2018). Candesartan potentially decrease the activity of angiotensin I receptor which contributes in the modulation of inflammation in AD (Trofimiuk et\xa0al. 2018).\n\n|   S.

Human  iPSCderived neurons are sensitive and require extended culture time (80\xa0days) to develop mature neuronal features; it is challenging to do this consistently and at a large scale by manually changing the culture medium [111]. Several strategies exist to overcome these challenges. Notch and γ-secretase  inhibitors  have  been  shown  to  shorten  the maturation  period  of  most  neuronal  cell  types  [13,  20]. Another approach includes overexpression of neuro-specific genes. For example, overexpression of Ngn2 accelerates the generation of forebrain and motor neuron cells to within 10\xa0days [52, 56]. In addition to shortening the time,  the  use  of  a  high-throughput  screening  platform for  aged  neurons  may  be  more  translatable.  Although scientists  have  differentiated  stem  cells  into  neurons, these  neurons  are  functionally  immature-similar  to embryonic or early postnatal neurons. The limited maturity  of  neurons  obtained  using  stem  cell  culture  techniques diminishes their potential for neurodegeneration research. However, recent studies have found that differentiating human iPSCs into motor and cortical neurons and then culturing them on synthetic nanofiber coatings with  high  internal  supramolecular  motion  can  enrich them into more mature neurons [2]. Furthermore, since sAD is influenced not only by risk genes but also epigenetics,  aging  and  environmental  factors  may  contribute to  its  development. The ability of iPSC models to accurately  mimic  the  sAD  phenotype  is  another  challenge in  disease  modeling  and  is  thought  to  be  an  important reason why numerous AD therapies effective in preclinical trials have poor clinical outcomes [33]. The development of more effective sAD models is thus an important goal for the future.\n\nCompared  to  2D  culture  systems,  3D  culture  platforms  are  better  suited  to  study  AD  pathophysiological mechanisms  involving  cell-cell  interactions,  controlled flow dynamics, circulating blood cells, and brain-specific microenvironments  [100].  However,  they  still  cannot mimic the intrinsic immune rejection reactions encountered  in  practical  clinical  applications.  There  are  also many  technical  challenges  facing  organoid  culture  and microfluidic technology. For example, human brain organoids lack the vasculature of brain tissue in\xa0vivo, which plays  a  facilitating  role  for  both  nutritional  supply  and neuronal cell differentiation. This lack of vascularity leads to  necrosis  in  brain-like  organ  centers,  further  interfering  with  normal  development  and  neuronal  migration routes. Although co-culture with vascular stem cells provides  a  partial  solution  to  these  problems,  the  issues  of nutrient  supply  and  the  true  blood  microenvironment remain. hESCs expressing human ETS variant 2 (ETV2) have  been  used  to  successfully  construct  brain  cortical organoids (hCOs) with vascular-like structures, including tight  junctions,  increased  expression  of  nutrient  transport  proteins,  and  transendothelial  resistance,  thereby addressing  the  challenge  of  missing  blood  vessels  [17]. However, further development is needed for their application in neurodegenerative disease. Regarding microfluidic technology, the requirements for reagent volume and reaction conditions are so stringent that small changes in the volume of reaction components can lead to changes in  the  results  [118].  Therefore,  the  clinical  usefulness  of this method needs to be further explored.\n\nFor drug screening, it is extremely important to select the appropriate early-onset predominant phenotype as a marker to measure the effect of the tested drug. In AD, the dominance of tau hyperphosphorylation or Aβ aberrant  deposition  phenotypes  has  still  not  been  elucidated.  As  a  result,  extensive  mechanistic  studies  are needed  before  applying  the  findings  to  drug  screening [21]. Since neurons, astrocytes, and microglia are highly specialized and disease-relevant cell types, the long time required  for  their  differentiation  limits  the  application of iPSC-derived glial cells in disease modeling and drug screening.  The  discovery  of  novel  strategies  to  promote gliogenesis is thus crucial for large-scale drug screening. Novel gene editing tools and biomolecular technologies, such  as  single-cell  RNA  sequencing,  could  also  enable more  accurate  disease  modeling  and  drug  screening processes.\n\nTo  summarize,  stem  cells  are  widely  used  in  disease modeling,  drug  screening,  and  cell  therapy  because  of\n\nTable 2 Stem cell-derived exosomes for AD treatment\n\n| Results at the

By  using  stem  cell-based platforms, AD research can better study the fundamental  biological  mechanisms  of  the  disease,  develop  new technologies,  and  innovate  on  therapeutic  concepts.  In the future, interdisciplinary collaborations should be fostered to build organoids or assemble spheroids and other multicellular models of human tissues comprising diverse cell types (e.g., excitatory/inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia).

Impaired intracellular degradation pathways further exacerbate the accumulation of pathological tau. A new strategy - targeted protein degradation recently emerged as a modality in drug discovery where bifunctional molecules bring the target protein close to the degradation machinery to promote clearance. Since 2016, this strategy has been applied to tau pathologies and attracted broad interest in academia and the pharmaceutical industry. However, a systematic review of recent studies on tau degradation mechanisms is lacking. Here we review tau degradation mechanisms (the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosome pathway), their dysfunction in AD, and tau-targeted degraders, such as proteolysistargeting chimeras and autophagy-targeting chimeras. We emphasize the need for a continuous exploration of tau degradation mechanisms and provide a future perspective for developing tau-targeted degraders, encouraging researchers to work on new treatment options for AD patients."", 'In several neurodegenerative illnesses, tau and alpha-synuclein ( α -Syn) play key roles in the manifestation of pathology. 146-148 Under pathological conditions, partially unfolded proteins like tau and α -Syn can form aberrant cellular aggregates and toxic oligomers. Genome-wide association studies of tau and α -Syn support their clinical relationship and the co-occurrence of their fibrillar aggregates in many illnesses. 149,150 In neurodegenerative diseases, multitarget treatment may hold significant promise for improving efficacy. Zhu et al. devised an innovative approach to targeting both tau and α -Syn: a dual PROTAC T3. 132 This PROTAC was developed by using 2-[49-(Methylamino)phenyl]-6-methylbenzothiazole (BTA) as tau and α -Syn target warhead and pomalidomide as E3 ligase cereblon (CRBN) binder. BTA, an analog of thioflavin-T, can be used as a warhead to degrade protein aggregates due to its high brain penetration and ability to bind to aggregates and oligomers. 130,131 Alabel-free fluorescence polarization assay demonstrated that BTA had a strong ability to bind to preformed fibrils from tau and α -Syn; the K D values were 2.55 ± 0.72 and 0.32 ± 0.17 µM, respectively. To increase the likelihood that the target protein would associate with the ubiquitin ligase complex, conformational flexible polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based chains were used. 151 The PEG4-derived linkers exhibited higher degradation efficiency compared to other types of linkers. A preformed tau fibrilseeding HEK293T cellular model and an α -Syn overexpression preformedfibril-seeding model in HEK293T cells were created to evaluate the degrading effects of T3. T3 induced a concentration-dependent decrease in total tau and p-tau levels following a 24-h treatment. T3 demonstrated the highest degradation rate ( D max ) of 61% and a half degradation concentration (DC 50 ) of 4.09 ± 0.90 µM against tau. Additionally, there was a notable decrease in the p-tau (S404) protein level. It is interesting to note that after 24 h of T3 therapy, p-tau was more effectively degraded than total tau. For α -Syn, T3 showed the greater degradation rate ( D max ) of 78% and the half degradation concentra-\n\nFIGURE 4 Chemical structures of small-molecule proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and autophagy-targeting chimeras (AUTOTACs) for tau degradation.

Following a 48-h T3 therapy, there was a substantial drop in the protein level of pα Syn (S129). T3 also reduced α -Syn aggregate-induced toxicity in the SH-SY5Y cell model stably overexpressing α -Syn treated with liposome-packaged preformed fibrils. Under mechanistic evaluation, T3 enhanced the interaction between ubiquitination and α -Syn in co-immunoprecipitation analysis, and T3-mediated clearance of tau and α -Syn was through UPS, proved by using proteasome inhibitor MG132 and NEDDylation inhibitor MLN4924. T3 showed good BBB permeability not only in a monolayer cell model but also in a mouse model, as visualized by fluorescence imaging and a pharmacokinetic study. In vivo effects of T3 were evaluated in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model. T3 treatment (8 mg/kg/day, i.v., 7 days) reduced total tau and p-tau (S404) in the midbrain and hippocampus and reduced α -Syn and pα Syn (S129) in the midbrain and substantia nigra pars compacta. Preliminary safety testing showed that T3 had no significant side effects up to 80 mg/kg/day for 2 days.

(A) PROTACs bring the target protein close to the E3 ligase, which results in protein ubiquitination, followed by proteasomal degradation. (B) AUTOTACssimultaneously interact with the target protein and the autophagy cargo receptor (eg, p62/SQSTM1), which facilitates p62/SQSTM1 self-polymerization in complex with target proteins. Then the complex is delivered to the phagophore by binding to LC3, followed by autophagosome formation and lysosomal degradation. (C) RING-Bait contains a RING domain of the E3 ligase tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) and a bait, such as the target protein. During the target protein aggregation, RING-Baits are recruited into the aggregates. This clustering dimerizes the RING domain and activates its E3 function, leading to subsequent proteasomal degradation.

Tau clearance induced by C8 in the HEK293-hTau cell model is through the UPS but not the ALP, as shown by using proteasome inhibitor MG132 and autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1. 129 C8 showed good blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability in BALB/C nude mice by in vivo imaging after intravenous injection (3.0 mg/kg). Purified pAAV-hSyn-hTau-mCHERRY-3 × FLAG virus was injected bilaterally into the hippocampus CA1 region of male C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks old) to induce hTau-overexpressed mouse model. In this mouse model, C8 treatment (10 mg/kg, i.p., 3 times/week for 1 month) ameliorated cognitive dysfunction in novel object recognition and Morris water maze and reduced total tau and p-tau levels in the hippocampus. 129', ""- Post-translational modifications, aggregation, and mutations affect tau degradation.\n- Avicious circle exists between impaired degradation pathways and tau pathologies.\n- Ubiquitin plays an important role in complex degradation pathways.\n- Tau-targeted degraders provide promising strategies for novel AD treatment.\n\npeople. 1 The prevalence of AD is increasing dramatically with aging populations worldwide. 2 The intracellular neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) of tau is one of the main neuropathological hallmarks in AD. 3-5 Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that plays an important role in\n\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made. ©2025TheAuthor(s).

Multiple strategies have been applied to ameliorate tau pathology in AD, such as inhibiting tau expression, modulating tau post-translational modifications, inhibiting tau aggregation, and promoting tau degradation. 12,13 Mostof the tau-targeting therapies in clinical trials are immunotherapies, 13,14 but tau antibodies have limited effect intracellularly, where most of thepathologicaltauaccumulates. 15 Analternativestrategyforincreasing tau clearance is targeted protein degradation, 16 which promotes the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP) for tau degradation. To guide the development of targetedproteindegradationoftau,weneedtounderstandthemechanismsoftaudegradationundernormalandpathologicalconditionsand find suitable target proteins involved in intracellular degradation pathways. Therefore, in this review we summarize the main intracellular tau degradation pathways, UPS and ALP, their mechanisms, crosstalk, key proteins involved in these pathways, and their dysfunction in AD. We discuss all reported small-molecule- and peptide-based tau-targeted degraders, such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and autophagy-targeting chimeras (AUTOTACs). Finally, we emphasize the need for the continuous exploration of tau degradation mechanisms and provide a future perspective for the development of tau-targeted degraders in AD."", 'Community 0: Contains concepts [""Alzheimer\'s disease"", \'heightened immune response\']...', 'Community 3: Contains concepts [\'Nrf2\', \'NF-kB\', ""Alzheimer\'s Disease"", \'JAK/STAT\', \'Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway\']...', ""Community 5: Contains concepts ['GSK3β signaling', 'pathophysiology of AD']...""]","The context mentions two specific types of ""chimeras"" as tau-targeted degraders: proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and autophagy-targeting chimeras (AUTOTACs) [1, 3, 5].",1.0,0.9174928672398224,8,gemini-2.0-flash

Each approach was adapted to suit the specific characteristics and requirements of the comparison, considering the nature of the data (pseudobulk for DESeq2 and single-cell method for MAST) and the level at which covariates were standardized (sample level for DESeq2 and ST spot or cell level for MAST). Covariate selection was guided by variance partition analysis, which identified gDNA as the primary driver of variance after the experimental group. Additionally, we accounted for the number of genes expressed in a subset of ST spots or cells to control for differences in quality and sequencing depth. Sex and age were included due to their known effects on immune responses in AD. Additionally, manually annotated regions or cortical layer annotations per ST spot were incorporated where applicable to address sampling variability across anatomical areas.\n\nDESeq2 . DESeq2 was initiated by subsetting the data for ST spots within the region of interest (ROI). Continuous covariates at the sample level, including age, average nFeatures within subsampled ST spots and gDNA percentage, were standardized within each ROI. We then filtered out genes not expressed in at least 1% of either comparison group based on raw counts, excluding genes starting with RPS, RPL, MT or HB. Pseudobulk data were created by summing raw counts by\n\ndonor to facilitate a more robust differential expression analysis. The DESeq2 analysis was conducted with the inclusion of covariates such as sex, age, average features within subsampled ST spots and gDNA percentage, all of which were standardized, if continuous. The DESeq function was run with fitType = 'local' to estimate dispersions using local regression, the results function was run with independentFiltering = FALSE to include low-expression genes in statistical testing, and LFC shrinkage was performed by running lfcShrink with type = 'apeglm'. P values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. DEG significance thresholds were set at an adjusted P value of 0.05 and a log2 fold change of ±log 2 (1.5).\n\nMAST . For MAST, data were subsetted to include only the ST spots or cells of interest. Sample-specific and brain region-specific downsampling was applied to ensure that no single sample contributed more than 50% of ST spots or cells within a comparison group, that the fold difference in total ST spots or cells between comparison groups did not exceed three, and that each group contained no more than 3,000 ST spots or cells. Continuous covariates at the ST spot level, including age, the CDR from recorrected SCT data and gDNA percentage per sample, were standardized within each subset of ST spots or cells. We applied PrepSCTFindMarkers on the ROI, which recorrects SCTransform counts to normalize sequencing depth across samples. SCT data (log1p-transformed SCT counts) were then extracted from the Seurat object. Genes prefixed with RPS, RPL, MT or HB were excluded, and additional filtering was performed based on percentage expression within comparison groups. Genes were tested if they were expressed in 1% of both groups and in 10% of either group using SCT expression data, except for Visium HD data, where genes were tested if they were expressed in 1% of either group. The log 2 fold change between comparison groups for the remaining genes was calculated using the Seurat FoldChange function. MAST was run with covariates such as sex, age, CDR, gDNA percentage, brain region and manually annotated regions or cortical layers, all of which were standardized if continuous. Sample ID, or brain region and sample ID, was included as a random effect for comparisons involving multiple samples. MAST hurdle P values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. LFC from the prior calculation was appended to the results, with significance thresholds for differential expression set at an adjusted P value of 0.05 and a LFC of ±log 2 (1.5)."", ""1.  Global.

The study design is randomized having quadruple masking with parallel assignment model. The estimated enrollment for the study is of 77 participants. The recruitment status of the study is completed. Candesartan being an angiotensin receptor blocker has a potential to prevent the AT2R binding. Stress stimuli such as cold, predator exposure activate release of RAS and Ang II. In familial AD mice models candesartan reduced nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase levels. It also reduced the hyperactivation of microglia in the hippocampal region of AD mice brains (Torika et\xa0al. 2018). Candesartan potentially decrease the activity of angiotensin I receptor which contributes in the modulation of inflammation in AD (Trofimiuk et\xa0al. 2018).\n\n|   S.

CRID3 (or CP-456773, MCC950) is a specific, commercially available inhibitor  of  NLRP3.  Interestingly,  it  was  known  for  many  years  that CRID3  could  block  IL-1 β ,  but  it  was  only  in  2015  that  CRID3  was identified  as  a  specific  NLRP3  inflammasome  inhibitor  (Coll  et  al., 2015). We now understand that CRID3 acts within the NACHT domain of NLRP3 to prevent its activity (Coll et al., 2019). Using cryo-electron microscopy,  Hochheiser  and  colleagues  recently  demonstrated  that CRID3  binds  into  a  specific  cleft  within  NLRP3,  that  connects  four NACHT subdomains with an LRR transition segment. Having unravelled the precise site of action of CRID3, this will undoubtedly facilitate the design of better, more potent inhibitors moving forward (Hochheiser et al., 2022a). While CRID3 has been used in clinical trials, it has high plasma protein binding (Primiano et al., 2016) and it unfortunately can induce liver toxicity in humans at higher concentrations (Torres et al., 2021; Mangan et al., 2018; Cross, 2020). This makes the compound ideal for mechanistic studies in vitro and in vivo ,  but obviously less so as a therapy for patients.\n\nIn terms of AD, CRID3 effectively blocked the A β (Lu ˇ ci ¯ unait ˙ e et al., 2020; McManus et al., 2022; Dempsey et al., 2017) or Tau (Ising et al., 2019; Stancu et al., 2019)-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro , preventing cleavage and release of caspase-1 and IL-1 β . In animal models, CRID3 could prevent the production of IL-1 β , reduced A β deposition and rescued memory impairments in the APP/PS1 model of AD (Dempsey et al., 2017). CRID3 also reduced Tau seeding in the P301S model  of  Tauopathy,  and  attenuated  the  Tau-induced  microgliosis (Stancu et al., 2019).\n\nThere  are  a  number  of  other  NLRP3  inflammasome  inhibitors  at various  stages  of  pre-clinical  (IFM-514  (Torres  et  al.,  2021),  CY-09 (Wang  et  al.,  2021))  or  clinical  trials  such  as  DFV890  (IFM-2427) (Madurka  et  al.,  2023),  OLT1177  (Marchetti  et  al.,  2018),  Tranilast (Huang et al., 2018), Oridonin (He et al., 2018), Selnoflast (McFarthing et al., 2023) or Inzomelid (IZD174) (Coll et al., 2022), see Table 1 for details.

OLT1177 reduces the ATPase activity of NLRP3, it  likely  binds  to that region (Marchetti et al., 2018). A recent study found  that  OLT1177  does  not  directly  bind  to  NLRP3  (Teske  et  al., 2024), however, this does not detract from the effectiveness of OLT1177 at preventing the release of active IL-1 β (Marchetti et al., 2018; Tengesdal et al., 2021; Oizumi et al., 2022; Lonnemann et al., 2020) and the promising  findings  from  the  ongoing  clinical  trials  (Table  1).  The structures of most of the compounds are not yet publicly available, thus it is unknown where they precisely bind to prevent NLRP3 inflammasome signalling. However, as some of these inhibitors are in clinical trials for those with Parkinson ' s disease or ALS (Selnoflast and ZYIL1) and  many  compounds are  additionally  BBB  penetrant  (Table  1),  the results of these trials will be of interest to many with strong implications for future treatments of AD."", ""1.

AD typically manifests as a progressive loss of memory and cognitive function. Cerebral plaques laden with amyloidβ (A β ) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of tau are important hallmarks of AD [1]. A β accumulation is associated with functional and structural brain alterations, consistent with the patterns of abnormalities seen in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well as AD [2]. The amyloid cascade hypothesis suggests that the deposition of A β triggers neuronal dysfunction, vascular damage, and cell death in the brain [3]. Moreover, A β has been reported to directly impair the glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) pathway [1]. In fact, patients with AD show insulin resistance in the brain [4].\n\nRegarding glucose metabolism disorders, diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common public health problems worldwide. The global prevalence of DM in 2019 was estimated to be 9.3% (463 million people), rising to 10.2% (578 million) by 2030 and 10.9% (700 million) by 2045 [5]. The pathogenesis of type 2 DM (T2DM) is primarily initiated by the inadequate function of pancreatic β -cells in response to glycemic overload, which then causes insulin resistance. Thus, patients with T2DM are relatively insulin deficient.\n\nHerein, it can be said that insulin plays an important role in the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiological hypometabolism of glucose in both AD and T2DM. In fact, T2DM was reported to predispose patients to neurodegenerative disorders, including AD [6]. A meta-analysis reported that the odds ratio for conversion from MCI into AD in patients\n\n/gid00001\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCitation: Takeishi, J.; Tatewaki, Y.; Nakase, T.; Takano, Y.; Tomita, N.; Yamamoto, S.; Mutoh, T.; Taki, Y.

Therefore, in this review, we will focus on the shared pathogeneses in AD and T2DM and the decreased use of glucose in the brain. To this end, for a potential of nonpharmacological molecular biology treatment, we will discuss the ketogenic diet (KD), a high-fat and low-carbohydrate diet in which coconut oil and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil are often used as an alternative source of energy against glucose."", ""Guoxiu Zu ͷ , Keyun Sun ͷ , Ling Li ͷ , Xiuli Zu \u0378 , Tao Han \u0379 * &amp; Hailiang Huang ͺ *\n\nQuercetin has demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, and hypolipidemic activities, suggesting therapeutic potential against type \u0378 diabetes mellitus ȋT\u0378DMȌ and Alzheimer's disease ȋADȌ. In this study, potential molecular targets of quercetin were first identified using the Swiss Target Prediction platform and pathogenic targets of T\u0378DM and AD were identified using online Mendelian inheritance in man ȋOMIMȌ, DisGeNET, TTD, DrugBank, and GeneCards databases. The 9ͻ targets shared among quercetin, T\u0378DM, and AD were used to establish a protein-protein interaction ȋPPIȌ network, top \u0378ͻ core genes, and protein functional modules using MCODE. Metascape was then used for gene ontology and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ȋKEGGȌ pathway enrichment analysis. A protein functional module with best score was obtained from the PPI network using CytoHubba, and ͼ high-probability quercetin targets ȋAKTͷ, JUN, MAPK, TNF, VEGFA, and EGFRȌ were confirmed by docking simulations. Molecular dynamics simulation was carried out according to the molecular docking results. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis suggested that the major shared mechanisms for T\u0378DM and AD include 'AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications,' 'pathways in cancer,' and 'MAPK signaling pathway' ȋthe key pathwayȌ. We speculate that quercetin may have therapeutic applications in T\u0378DM and AD by targeting MAPK signaling, providing a theoretical foundation for future clinical research.\n\nAccording to the 2017 global burden of disease study, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the sixth and tenth leading causes of premature death   worldwide 1 , and many studies have found strong epidemiological, pathological, and clinical associations between T2DM and   AD 2 . The incidence of AD is about twofold greater in T2DM patients than in non-diabetic individuals, while a disproportionate number of AD patients have a history of early or clinical diabetes. Diabetes and AD also share numerous common risk factors, including metabolic disease (obesity), cardiovascular disease, older age, and progressive insulin   resistance 2 , as well as common pathogenic processes such as chronic hyperglycemia, tissue amyloid β (Aβ) deposition and toxicity, cellular oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation.\n\nIndeed, the term 'type 3 diabetes' has been proposed to describe AD based on the hypothesis that ADassociated dementia is caused in part by insulin resistance and insufficient insulin-like growth factor signaling in the   brain 3 . It is believed that endocrine and metabolic diseases characterized by elevated blood glucose due to insulin resistance and death of insulin-producing pancreatic islet β-cells can lead to chronic cardiovascular diseases and ultimately to AD. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of Aβ in the brain parenchyma (termed senile plaques, SPs) and abnormal hyperphosphorylation of the intermediate filament protein tau within neurons, forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). The presence of these inclusions results in synaptic loss, particularly in neocortex and hippocampus, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, ultimately leading to neuronal dysfunction and   death 4 . Tau protein and human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) deposits are also found in the pancreatic islets of T2DM patients. Moreover, pharmacological studies have shown that some traditional hypoglycemic drugs can slow the progression of   AD 4 .\n\nͷ Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan \u0378ͻͶ\u0379ͻͻ, China. \u0378 Department  of  Pharmacy,  Shandong  University  of  Chinese  Medicine,  Jinan  \u0378ͻͶ\u0379ͻͻ,  China. \u0379 Graduate Office, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan \u0378ͻͶ\u0379ͻͻ, China.  ͺ Department of Rehabilitation Medicine,  Shandong  University  of  Traditional  Chinese  Medicine,  Jinan  \u0378ͻͶ\u0379ͻͻ,  China. * email:  ͼͶͶͷ\u0378ͶͶ\u0378@ sdutcm.edu.cn ; ͶͼͶͶͶͶ\u0379ͷ@sdutcm.edu.cn\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=25,font=/WDEGSW+Corbel&gt;ol.:ȋͬͭͮͯ\n\nVol:.(1234567890)\n\nWhile there is strong evidence for an association between T2DM and AD at multiple levels, the seminal molecular mechanisms linking these disorders remain unknown. One potential strategy for identifying these molecular linkage pathways is to screen for common drug targets, which would also provide new possibilities for the treatment of T2DM and AD.\n\nQuercetin (3, 3 ′ , 4 ′ , 5, 7-pentahydroxyflavone) is a natural polyhydroxyflavonoid found in the flowers, leaves, and fruits of edible plants such as onion, apple, lettuce, and   cabbage 4 . In addition, many Chinese herbal medicines such as Sophora japonica, Ginkgo biloba leaves, Hypericum perforatum, and cortex moutan are enriched in   quercetin 5 . Numerous studies have documented bioactivities of quercetin relevant to T2DM and AD pathology, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, and hypolipidemic effects. Quercetin has also been shown to reduce blood glucose concentration and preserve islet function, insulin sensitivity, and β-cell numbers in diabetic model rats and   mice 6,7 .\n\nAt present, there is no broadly effective drug treatment to delay AD onset, slow progression, or improve outcome 8 , and the few approved mediations can only transiently improve   symptoms 9 . Also, many synthetic drugs with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, and (or) hypolipidemic activities induce adverse events that preclude clinical use. The use of natural substances to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and metabolic diseases such as T2DM is a promising alternative as such agents are often easily and inexpensively isolated and have well documented biomechanisms and safety profiles. Yao et\xa0al. conducted a cross-sectional study of nearly 20,000   people 10 . The results show that there is a significant negative correlation between dietary quercetin intake and the prevalence of T2DM in Chinese population, which suggests that dietary quercetin intake may play a positive role in the prevention and treatment of T2DM, such as anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory, blood sugar and blood lipid. At the same time, it is supported by   experiments 7 , Supplementation of quercetin can reduce the blood glucose concentration and promote islet in diabetic rats. β Cell recovery and increased insulin release. Quercetin has insulin sensitizing effect. Long term low-dose dietary supplementation can reduce insulin resistance (IR) 6 in diabetic mice. Quercetin and its glycosides have extensive neuroprotective effects against AD, and its mechanism mainly includes interference β-the formation and deposition of starch protein can inhibit the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein to intervene the disease development process of AD. It can play a protective role on nerve cells through anti-inflammatory response, antioxidant stress and inhibition of apoptosis. In addition, it also has estrogen like effect on nerve cells. In recent years, the estrogen like neuroprotective effect of quercetin has attracted more and more attention. Epidemiology found that the probability of ad in postmenopausal women is much higher than that in men, suggesting that estrogen reduction is a risk factor for AD, and estrogen replacement therapy may prevent and delay the occurrence of AD. Quercetin has also shown anti-dementia and neuroprotective efficacies in models of dementia/AD and ischemia-reperfusion injury by mitigating neuronal oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, and by improving calcium homeostasis, growth factor signaling, and neuroplasticity, ultimately preventing neuronal   apoptosis 11-15 . Further, a number of large double-blind clinical studies have demonstrated that quercetin can reduce the composite end-point of death in patients with T2DM and AD. In the present study, we used a systematic bioinformatics approach (network pharmacology) and molecular docking simulations to identify quercetin-binding targets that may also be potential therapeutic targets for AD and T2DM."", ""Screening of potential quercetin targets. The Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) was used to search for preparations with 'quercetin' as a key word, and results were then combined with the Chinese Medicine Encyclopedia database (ETCM) to find Chinese herbal medicines enriched in quercetin. Quercetin targets were then identified using the PubChem database with 'quercetin' as the key word. Based on the notion that drugs of similar structure will have common (overlapping) targets, five potential targets of quercetin were predicted using Swiss Target Prediction (http://  www.  swiss  targe  tpred  iction. ch/) 16 with species 'Homo sapiens' and a probability &gt; 0.1 as the selection criteria. Target names were standardized according to Uniprot protein database terminology (https://  www.  unipr  ot.  org/) 17 .\n\nScreening of quercetin targets for T\u0378DM and AD treatment. Pathogenic molecules contributing to T2DM and AD was screened using Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM, https://  omim.  org/) 18  TTD (http://  db.  idrbl  ab.  net/  ttd/),  DisGeNET  (https://  www.  disge  net.  org/),  DrugBank  (https://  www.  drugb  ank.  ca/) 19 , and  GeneCards  (https://  www.  genec  ards.  org/) 20 using  the  terms  'Type  2  diabetes  mellitus'  and  ' Alzheimer's Disease. ' By intersecting quercetin targets with disease-associated molecules targets using a Venn diagram, we obtained targets potentially relevant to T2DM and AD treatment. Cytoscape   software 21 was then used to map the component-target-disease network as described in detail below.\n\nConstruction  of  protein-protein  interaction  ȋPPIȌ  network. To  identify  interaction  targets  of quercetin potentially relevant to T2DM and AD pathology and treatment, we used the online drawing tool Interactive Venn (http://  www.  inter  activ  enn.  net/) 22 to construct a Venn diagram. The overlapping targets were then uploaded to the STRING11.0 platform (https://  string-  db.  org/) 23 to  obtain  a  protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The maximal clique centrality (MMC) algorithm in the CytoHubba plug-in was used for comprehensive analysis of network topology to obtain the top 25 hub   genes 23 .  Then   MCODE 24 ,  a  cluster analysis plug-in for Cytoscape3.6.0 (https://  cytos  cape.  org/), was utilized to further analyze the PPI network. The targets in the protein functional module with best MCODE score were selected as core targets for further molecular docking simulations.\n\nFigure\xa01. Flowchart of the network pharmacology study investigating quercetin targets for T2DM and AD treatment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnrichment analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) functional analysis  and  Kyoto  Encyclopedia  of  Genes  and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed using Metascape (https://  metas  cape.  org/) 25 , with p &lt;  0.01 as the cutoff criterion. The top 10 GO items and top 20 KEGG pathways that meet this criterion were visualized using OmicShare (http://  www.  omics  hare.  com/) and microscopic letter (http://  www.  bioin  forma tics.  com.  cn).\n\nConstruction of a component-target-pathway network. Cytoscape3.6.0 was used to construct a component-target-pathway network based on KEGG enrichment analysis, and the topological parameters of the network were analyzed using the built-in Network Analyzer tool.\n\nMolecular docking verification. The PDB formats of the core target proteins were downloaded from the RCSB PDB database (http://  www.  rcsb.  org/). We used PyMol 2.4 software to remove water molecules and separate the original ligand from the core target protein, and then imported the processed protein targets into AutoDock Tools 1.5.6   software 26 for  hydrogenation,  calculation  of  total  charge,  and  setting  the  atomic  type. Results were saved in 'pdbqt' format. The mol2 structures of the core targets were downloaded from the TCMSP database, and AutoDock Tools was used to set the rotatable bonds. Files were again saved in 'pdbqt' format and then imported to AutoDock Vina to perform molecular docking. Finally, PyMol software was used to visualize the docking results and establish the docking interaction pattern.\n\nMolecular dynamics simulation. Amber14 was used for molecular dynamics simulation. Amber-99sb force field was used for protein system, gaff force field was used for quercetin molecule, TIP3P water molecule model and periodic boundary were used. All systems were first optimized, temperature rise and equilibrium, and then 50\xa0ns molecular dynamics simulation was carried out by sander. Take the trajectory of 10-50\xa0ns and calculate the binding energy between quercetin and protein using mm/pbsa.py. Analyze the trajectory using the cpptraj module in ambertools.

Therefore, enhancing insulin sensitivity and reducing β-cell apoptosis are the ultimate strategies for the prevention and treatment of   T2DM 31 . Several studies have found that quercetin can reduce blood glucose, peripheral insulin resistance, and indicators of oxidative stress induced by high glucose in rats, a response profile similar to the widely used antidiabetic drug metformin.\n\nAlzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Clinically, it is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment, memory loss, and marked changes in personality and behavior. The two primary hypotheses proposed to explain the progressive neurodegeneration and neurological impairments of AD are cytotoxic β-amyloid deposition (plaque formation) due to abnormal processing and hyperphosphorylation of tau as these are the pathological hallmarks of the AD brain. In turn, these plaques and NFTs may cause oxidative stress and inflammation, leading to synaptic failure, neuronal apoptosis (especially basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and various hippocampal and cortical neurons), and brain   atrophy 32,33 . These pathomechanisms are not mutually exclusive and indeed may interact, creating pathogenic cascades. Thus, many protein signaling pathways and gene regulation pathways may contribute to the pathological changes in AD.\n\nMany natural components found in traditional herbal preparations have documented antioxidant, antiinflammatory, antidiabetic, and anti-apoptotic activities, suggesting potential utility for AD and T2DM treatment. For instance, quercetin can improve insulin production by rat insulinoma INS-1 cells in response to high glucose, as well as downregulate the relative expression levels of pro-apoptotic Bax and PDX-1 mRNAs, inhibit oxidative stress caused by   H 2 O2, and reduce INS-1 cell   apoptosis 34 . Quercetin can also clear reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species and inhibit the level of low density lipoprotein peroxidase, thereby reducing the incidence of cardiovascular   disease 35 . Further, quercetin was shown to reduce ischemic injury and peroxynitrate injury by inhibiting nitric oxide synthase and xanthine dehydrogenase   activities 36 .\n\nThe current study revealed several potential molecular mechanisms for AD and T2DM as well as possible treatment targets by combining network pharmacology with molecular docking. By integrating and collating information from several databases, we identified 95 potential quercetin targets involved in T2DM and AD pathology, and further defined a potential protein functional module of five proteins and 25 core genes from the PPI network. The biological processes mediated by these functional module proteins include protein kinase signaling and cell proliferation, consistent with pathogenic pathways of T2DM and AD identified in previous studies.\n\nCytoHubba and MCODE identified AKT1, JUN, MAPK, TNF, VEGFA, and EGFR as core targets of quercetin that may contribute to AD and T2DM. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is anti-apoptotic, and AKT1 inhibits Akt phosphorylation (activation), which in turn upregulates the activity of GSK3β, a kinase implicated in the pathogenesis of both T2DM and AD. JUN is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family implicated in the onset, progression, and reversal of vascular diseases through modulation of vascular cell protein expression, proliferation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Downregulation of JUN can significantly reduce the expression of inflammatory factors and inhibit endothelial cell   apoptosis 37 . Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a multifunctional cytokine that can directly damage islet β-cells and induce insulin resistance by inhibiting the transduction of insulin signals. MAPK is a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and inflammatory   responses 38 . Activation of MAPK can also increase tau phosphorylation in   neurons 39 , while inhibition of MAPK expression in hippocampus can significantly improve memory, cognitive function, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal   metabolism 40 . Suppression of MAPK can also improve insulin resistance by upregulating the expression of the insulin-dependent glucose transporter GLUT-4 in striatal muscle and adipose tissue, and by enhancing the sensitivity of insulin receptors, thereby promoting the absorption and utilization of glucose. Therefore, MAPK may be a core target for the treatment of T2DM and   AD 41 .\n\nFigure\xa09.

The target genes were mainly related to cell apoptosis, regulation of inflammatory response, regulation of ROS, metallic process, and other biological processes. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that target proteins are involved in the MAPK, TNF, HIF-1, IL-17, PI3K, NF-kappa B, Toll-like receptor, and VEGF signaling pathways, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, pathways in cancer, proteoglycans in cancer, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesize that quercetin may play a therapeutic role in T2DM and AD through the regulation of these pathways, but especially through modulation of MAPK signaling (Fig.\xa09).\n\nA variety of extracellular signaling molecules (growth factors, neurotransmitters, cytokines, hormones, etc.) stimulate MAPK signaling via the MAPKKK-MAPKK cascade, ultimately regulating both cytoplasmic processes and gene expression pathways underlying cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and stress responses. Three parallel MAPK signaling pathways are found in mammalian cells, extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). Inhibiting MAPK signaling can reduce oxidative stress and ensure the normal proliferation, differentiation, and insulin secretion capacity of islet   cells 42 . Further, inhibition of the MAPK pathway can improve learning and   memory 43 and suppress apoptosis of hippocampal CA1 neurons by downregulating the transcription factor c-Fos. Activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway may be an important mechanism underlying early and medium-term cognitive impairment in rats, while inhibition can reduce damage and promote the repair of damaged neurons. Quercetin acts on membrane EGFRs and TNFR1 by promoting the release of VEGFA and TNF, thereby affecting the activation of Ras, Raf, MEK, and phosphorylation of MAPK1 and MAPK3, leading to changes in angiogenesis, cell apoptosis, and cell proliferation. More in-depth studies on these mechanisms and preclinical studies in T2DM and AD animal models are warranted to provide a foundation for future clinical studies targeting the MAPK signaling pathway as a novel therapeutic strategy for T2DM and AD.\n\nIn conclusion, we have identified several potential molecular mechanisms by which quercetin can simultaneously interfere with T2DM and AD progression. Among these, suppression of MAPK signaling appears to be the most promoting strategy for the treatment of T2DM and AD."", 'Community 0: Contains concepts [""Alzheimer\'s disease"", \'heightened immune response\']...', 'Community 3: Contains concepts [\'Nrf2\', \'NF-kB\', ""Alzheimer\'s Disease"", \'JAK/STAT\', \'Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway\']...', ""Community 5: Contains concepts ['GSK3β signaling', 'pathophysiology of AD']...""]","Based on the context provided, the KEGG analysis identified the ""MAPK signaling pathway"" as the key pathway shared by both T2DM and AD [10].",1.0,0.8859038613799145,16,gemini-2.0-flash
