      "the term 'type diabetes' has been proposed to describe AD based on the hypothesis that ADassociated dementia is caused in part by insulin resistance and insufficient insulin-like growth factor signaling in the   brain . It is believed that endocrine and metabolic diseases characterized by elevated blood glucose due to insulin resistance and death of insulin-producing pancreatic islet β-cells can lead to chronic cardiovascular diseases and ultimately to AD. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of Aβ in the brain parenchyma (termed senile plaques",
      "SPs) and abnormal hyperphosphorylation of the intermediate filament protein tau within neurons",
      "forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). The presence of these inclusions results in synaptic loss",
