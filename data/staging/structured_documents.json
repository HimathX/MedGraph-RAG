        "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major contributor of dementia leading to the degeneration of neurons in the brain with major symptoms like loss of memory and learning. Many evidences suggest the involvement of neuroinflammation in the pathology of AD. Cytokines including TNF-α and IL-6 are also found increasing the BACE1 activity and expression of NFκB resulting in generation of Aβ in AD brain. Following the interaction of Aβ with microglia and astrocytes, other inflammatory molecules also get translocated to the site of inflammation by chemotaxis and exaggerate neuroinflammation. Various pathways like NFκB, p38 MAPK, Akt/mTOR, caspase, nitric oxide and COX trigger microglia to release inflammatory cytokines. PPARγ agonists like pioglitazone increases the phagocytosis of Aβ and reduces inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Celecoxib and roficoxib like selective COX-2 inhibitors also ameliorate neuroinflammation. Non-selective COX inhibitor indomethacin is also potent inhibitor of inflammatory mediators released from microglia. Mitophagy process is considered quite helpful in reducing inflammation due to microglia as it promotes the phagocytosis of over activated microglial cells and other inflammatory cells. Mitophagy induction is also beneficial in the removal of damaged mitochondria and reduction of infiltration of inflammatory molecules at the site of accumulation of the damaged mitochondria. Targeting these pathways and eventually ameliorating the activation of microglia can mitigate neuroinflammation and come out as a better therapeutic option for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nKeywords Alzheimer's disease · Neuroinflammation · Molecular pathways · Therapeutics",

        "content": "Multiple factors are involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease which makes it difficult to find the complete cure for the disease. Biomarkers related pathologies have also been observed (Sweeney et al. 2019). The major attributes of Alzheimer's disease are senile plaques or Aβ plaques generated by the abnormal cleavage of Amyloid Precursor\n\n* Dibbanti HariKrishna Reddy harikrishnareddy0011@gmail.com; harikrishna.reddy@cup.edu.in\n\n1 Department of Pharmacology, Central University of Punjab, Bathinda 151 401, India\n\n2 Department of Pharmacology, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh 160 012, India\n\n3 Department of Ophthalmology, Government Medical College &amp; Hospital, Chandigarh 160 032, India\n\nProtein (APP) and neurofibrillary tangles produced by hyperphosphorylation of tau. Brain regions mostly affected by the disease are hippocampus, neocortex and amygdala. Alzheimer's disease leads to dementia which accounts for over 131.5 million people worldwide (Sengoku 2020). Out of all dementia cases across the globe AD accounts for 90% of the whole. Behavioral and psychological symptoms are common in AD (Kales et al. 2019). It is believed that Alzheimer's disease symptoms arise after 20 years of acquiring the disease. The nerve cells involved in thinking, memory and learning get damaged due to which symptoms like memory loss and language difficulties arise. This makes the patient unable to perform his routine works. Gradually the person becomes bedridden and ultimately leads to death of the Alzheimer's Association (2019). Vascular diseases, age, head trauma, family history, low physical activity, environmental factors and smoking are major risk elements of the disease. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis and amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) are helpful in the diagnosis of the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndisease. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), brain biopsy and Retinal Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging are other diagnostic methods among which brain biopsy is considered to be the most definitive one (Atri 2019).\n\nOut of the multiple factors responsible for the disease neuroinflammation has a vital role (Fig. 1). Studies suggest the involvement of over-activation of microglial cells and astrocytes along with inflammatory molecules in the pathogenesis of the disease (Uddin et al. 2020). Neuroinflammation acts as double edged sword for the brain, as it clears deposited Aβ and produces cytotoxic substances which aggravate the deposition of Aβ and cause neurodegeneration. Many experiments proved high accumulation of inflammatory mediators around NFTs and amyloid plaques which makes the involvement of neuroinflammation in AD quite evident (Ahmad et al. 2019).\n\nMajor inflammatory cells in the CNS are microglia and astrocytes. Microglia are macrophages which cover 10% of the total population of cells in the CNS. It is involved in the neuronal plasticity and neurogenesis and acts as first line of defense in any injury of the brain. Major Cytokines found in AD brains are Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6). The activity of β-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1) and nuclear factor κB (NFκB) is increased by these cytokines resulting in increased generation of Aβ (Calsolaro and Edison 2016). Aging has profound effect in the pathogenesis of AD, it also affects innate immunity of the body. Inflammasomes are the structures responsible for the release\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFig. 1 Pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Figure 1 depicts the multiple  factors  responsible  for  the  progression  of  Alzheimer's  disease.  Amyloid  plaques  and  hyperphosphorylated  tau  are  the  major ones.  Extracellular  amyloid  β  deposition  leads  to  the  generation  of senile plaques. Hyperphosphorylated tau leads to the disassembly of microtubules  and  damages  the  cytoskeleton  and  signal  transduction processes  in  neuronal  cells.  Other  factors  like  neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, cholinergic insufficiency, mitochondrial dysfunction and  autophagy  dysfunction  also  play  major  role  in  the  disease  progression\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof interleukins but during aging there is marked reduction of inflammasomes leading to reduction in cytokines (Cao and Zheng 2018). Due to the degeneration of neurons there is infiltration of inflammatory mediators, activation of innate immune system and glial cells at the accumulation site. It is believed that this occurs at initial stages of the disease and contributes in the progression of the disease (Deardorff and Grossberg 2017).\n\nMild activation of microglia is beneficial as it clears the cell debris, damaged neurons and promotes survival of cells in the brain. But if there is chronic inflammation of neurons the microglia and other inflammatory cells get hyperactivated which can be toxic to the neuronal cells (Domingues et al. 2017). When microglia becomes hyperactive, a protein known as Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) is also highly expressed which serves as a biomarker and helps in imaging of inflammation in the brain and TSPO levels are monitored by employing PET techniques (Knezevic and Mizrahi 2018). Reduction in the infiltration of inflammatory molecules and removal of damaged mitochondria is stimulated by an innate system of the body known as mitophagy (Lautrup et al. 2019).",

        "content": "Inflammation is a response produced towards any injury, trauma or infection to the cells and tissues. It is believed that brain and immune system has a biochemical link. Inflammation that occurs in the brain is known as neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation is sometimes beneficial and sometimes destructing to the neuronal cells as over-activation of the inflammatory molecules can cause damage to the cells of the brain (Fig. 2) (Shabab et al. 2017). Neuroinflammation leads to activation of inflammatory cells in the brain including microglia and astrocytes. The brain is regarded as an \"immunological privileged organ\" because peripheral immune cells are expected not to enter the blood-brain barrier. Rather, glial cells-microglia and astrocytes, are the primary component of the committed neuroimmune system, and interrelate with peripheral immunity but not clearly justified. The glial cells provide favorable and anti-inflammatory actions under normal and pathological conditions, counting phagocytosis, steroid release, free radical depletion, and repairing of cells. Release of cytokines and generation of free radicals can cause neuronal cell death and synaptic dysfunction. So if there is imbalance between the regulations of proinflammatory anti-inflammatory function, it can cause brain injury (Schain and Kreisl 2017).\n\nMicroglia and astrocytes are the two main constituents of the immune system of brain and they have a key function in the neuroinflammation process. In normal conditions microglia have a phagocytic action which removes\n\nFig. 2 Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. Figure 2 shows the hyperactive glial cells including astrocytes and microglia upon interaction between Aβ and tau. Microglia and astrocytes are the major cells in the brain responsible for inflammatory responses. Due to the activation of glial cells various pro-inflammatory mediators are released which direct more inflammatory molecules at the site of injury leading to exaggerated inflammatory response in brain called neuroinflammation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndamaged neurons thus encourages the repair of tissue at the site of invasion by foreign molecules or pathogens where the immune functions of the cells are initiated. Astrocytes remove the debris from the cerebrospinal fluid and play a neuroprotective role. In Alzheimer's disease there is accretion of these cells around the NFTs and senile plaques. In activated state these cells release cytokines, interleukins and chemokines which act as pro-inflammatory components and potentiate the neuroinflammatory process in the brain contributing to AD (Walters et al. 2016).\n\nApoE is the risk element for Alzheimer disease that possesses immunomodulatory action. This capacity of ApoE is conjugated with triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which is mediated by microglia in the CNS (Shi et al. 2018). Elevated levels of cytokines in the brain are closely linked with AD. The interleukins and TNF α along with Cox-2 are the major cytokines considered to be involved. Cytokines generation in the brain mediated by Aβ also promotes microglia mediated free radical generation. In general IL-1 is involved in the progression of AD which is released from neurons, astrocytes and microglia. IL-1 enhances the abnormal processing of APP and generates Aβ. There is an increased concentration of IL-1 in the brain of AD patients. Aβ is generally considered to increase the interleukin levels. In contrast, it is seen that interleukins are responsible to generate Aβ from neurons and astrocytes. IL-1 also induces the release of other cytokines and increase NOS activity which results in toxicity of neurons (Sawikr et al. 2017).",

        "content": "Interleukins  are  secreted  by  leukocytes  and  activated microglia. Interleukins promote the activation of T-lymphocytes mediated toxicity and increase the activity of macrophages and neutrophils. It has various receptors including IL-6 receptors which in normal concentrations are helpful in neuronal cell survival but increased activation of IL-6 may lead to neurodegeneration. Mutations in IL-6 may potentiate the risk of AD. Other receptors are IL-1β, IL-1α, IL-9, IL-17, IL-15, IL-16, IL-12, IL-18, IL-4 and IL-10. IL-4 decreases the clearance of Aβ and thus enhances deposition of Aβ leading to the formation of senile plaques. IL-10 suppresses the activity of several pro-inflammatory mediators and thus acts as antiinflammatory molecule. IL-18 activates the production of interferon-γ. These all somehow are related to the pathogenesis of AD either indirectly by activating inflammatory mediators leading to neuroinflammation or directly by causing neurotoxicity (Bagyinszky et al. 2017).\n\nNeuroinflammation in AD is believed to be basically determined by microglial cells. Aβ oligomers and fibrils are equipped for preparing microglial cells through communications with different receptors, which improve the generation  of  provocative  cytokines  and  chemokines [interleukin-1,  interleukin-6,  tumor  necrosis  factor  α (TNF-α), C1q etc.] and make microglia progressively vulnerable to auxiliary boosts, stimulating microglial activation. In AD, conglomeration of Aβ brings about\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninterminable stimulation of microglia, improving generation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which further enhances the levels of activated microglia (Marttinen et al. 2018).\n\nInflammatory cytokines are released from glial cells and are of two types, pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory. As the name suggests pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α enhance inflammation by mediating microglial activation and increasing Aβ thus contributing to inflammation mediated progression of AD (Cai et al. 2014).\n\nChemokines are chemotactic cytokines which act as mediator of AD by stimulating chemotaxis in the brain. Chemokines are comprised of four families: CXC, CC, CX3C and C, according to the number and cysteine buildups in the N-terminal, otherwise called α, β, γ and δ chemokines, respectively. Microglia, astrocytes and neurons are the key cells responsible for the synthesis of chemokines and their receptors. Under inflammatory and diseased condition the chemokines produced by CNS are CCL2, CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL5 and CCL3. Chemokines direct microglia and astrocytes to the site of neuroinflammation aggravating local inflammation (Domingues et al. 2017).\n\nIn  AD  patients  the  Cd11b  integrin  was  found  overexpressed in neutrophils present peripherally which potentiates the adhesion and translocation of neutrophils. Some studies also suggested the increased level of free radicals in peripheral neutrophils. It was found that neutrophils are hyperactive in AD brains. Lymphocyte function associated antigen -1 (LFA-1) is an integrin present on neutrophils whose activity is increased by Aβ proteins. It is believed that the infilteration of neutrophils is highly regulated by LFA-1 and depletion in the LFA-1 levels reduces the migration of neutrophils towards the brain and this leads to decrease in the levels of phosphorylated tau and improved cognitive functions in AD patients (Stock et al. 2018).",

        "title": "Various pathways playing role in neuroinflammation",
        "content": "The toll-like receptors are responsible for the activation of NFκB pathways. It is a transcription factor specific to B-lymphocytes. Activation of NFκB initiates phagocytosis mediated by microglia, release cytokines and activates molecules which are required for the function of adaptive immune response. IκBα regulates the activity of NFκB along with its translocation in nucleus. Nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor α (IκBα) is an inhibitory molecule which when removed from NFκB, leads to its activation. TNF-α and IL-1β also activate the NFκB pathway. Ubiquitin inhibits NF-κB, degrades IκB, processing of precursors of NFκB and activation of IKK (Shabab et al. 2017).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn brain, NFκB signaling occurs mainly in microglia, to some extent in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes but neurons are devoid of this signaling. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) is another transcription factor which regulates various anti-oxidant pathways. Due to inflammation in AD there occurs oxidative stress and increased activation of microglia and astrocytes which leads to increased NFκB activity and deformed activity of Nrf2. It is believed on the basis of various studies that NRf2 by increasing antioxidant activity can mitigate NFκB activity and hence play a neuroprotective role. Redox status of the cells regulate the expression of NFκB, which in turn is regulated by Nrf2 (Liddell 2017).\n\nActivation of microglia also leads to the induction of other  signaling  pathway  like  PI3K/Akt  pathway  which is involved in apoptosis and regulation of inflammatory responses. NFκB translocation is also promoted by activation of PI3K. In turn PI3K is activated by Akt by undergoing various downstream pathways. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) also belongs to PI3 kinase family. Activation of PI3K leads to activation of Akt which subsequently activates mTOR. Microglia activation takes place as soon as there is initiation of phosphorylation of mTOR. mTOR further regulates the activity of NFκB proportionally. Increase in mTOR activation eventually increases the activity of NFκB which leads to stimulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and Cox-2 (Shabab et al. 2017).\n\nNormally inflammation in brain is associated with two types of cycloxygenase enzymes counting cox-1 and cox-2. Cox-1 is present in neurons of cerebral cortex and hippocampus whereas cox-2 is over-expressed due to inflammation in both activated microglia and neurons. Inflammatory mediators in neuroinflammation activate cox-2 which synthesizes and releases prostaglandins via arachidonic pathway and this prostaglandin further stimulates microglia. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is mostly involved in microglia and macrophages and its receptors are predominantly found in microglia (Sil and Ghosh 2016).\n\nAMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is believed to play an advantageous role in neuroinflammation by modulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT1) and blocking the expression of interferon γ (IFNγ), iNOS and TNF-α. AMPK also protects neurons from glutamate excitotoxicity. AMPK activators in some studies also showed attenuated NFκB activity. But the activation of AMPK is found detrimental according to some studies, therefore, the exact role of AMPK is still unclear (Peixoto et al. 2017).\n\nLipopolysaccharides also induce mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway along with NFκB pathway. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular-signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38 are the major signaling pathways underlying MAPKs. MAPK pathways are majorly involved in regulating immune response, oxidative stress and\n\napoptosis. Anti-inflammatory molecules like neurotropin reduce the activation of p38, ERK and JNK pathways by ameliorating the phosphorylation of these, thus inhibiting the MAPK pathway which leads to induction of inflammation (Zheng et al. 2018).\n\nInterferon γ binds to the interferon γ receptors and activates the M1 state of microglia via JAK/STAT pathway leading to its activation followed by release of various cytokines and chemokines. Phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF3) leads to the generation of interferon type 1 (IFN-β) which binds to its receptors and activates janus kinase family which further phosphorylates and activates STAT. This STAT then enters into the nucleus and activates interferon stimulation genes which results in the release of various inflammatory mediators (Thawkar and Kaur 2019).\n\nNitric oxide is a signaling molecule which is synthesized by three forms of nitric oxide synthase enzymes counting neuronal NOS, endothelial NOS and inducible NOS. Inducible NOS is activated only in pathological conditions of AD in brain particularly in microglia. Lipopolysaccharides, TNFα, interleukins and IFNγ are capable of stimulating iNOS. Increased levels of NO can induce nitration of several proteins in the brain leading to neuronal apoptosis. Further increase in the level of iNOS and NO the production of free radicals is also increased which significantly contributes in increasing the cytotoxic effects in the neuronal cells. Under normal levels NO is helpful in cell proliferation (Shabab et al. 2017).",

        "content": "As pro-inflammatory cytokines and their receptors are major contributors of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease, inhibiting cytokines gene expression and blocking or binding their receptors can come out to be a better therapeutic option for treatment of AD. Antibodies are used to counteract the effects of IL1-β and TNF-α along with its receptors. Anti-inflammatory molecules like minocycline are also employed for reducing Aβ and tau pathologies by mitigating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from glial cells. Inhibition of iNOS and cox-2 is also considered effective in ameliorating neuroinflammation in AD patients (Bronzuoli et al. 2016).\n\nMitophagy is a process which is involved in the clearance of damaged mitochondria which is also emerging out as a good option in mitigating neuroinflammation in AD. In AD, there is decrease in mitophagy process which enhances neuroinflammation due to reduced phagocytosis and excessive stimulation of microglia which leads to increased accumulation of Aβ plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau. Damaged mitochondria accretion also leads to the activation of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) which on gaining entry into the cytoplasm act as pro-inflammatory molecules and stimulate NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes, IL-1β activation and caspase-1 activation. Urolithin A and actinonin mitigate neuroinflammation and enhance microglial phagocytosis by increasing mitophagy resulting in decreased tau and amyloid β accumulation. IL-10 which is an anti-inflammatory cytokine is also responsible for mitigating inflammation by phosphorylating AMPK and activating STAT-3/ DNA damage inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4) pathway and inhibiting mTOR which potentiates the mitophagy process (Lautrup et al. 2019). M1 state of microglia can be modulated into M2 state which has neuroprotective role. Therefore, microglial polarization can be a potential target. A second generation tetracycline known as minocycline is selective for inhibiting M1 state of microglia and resulting in anti-neuroinflammatory effects in brain of AD patients (Regen et al. 2017).\n\nAt present there are various drugs under investigation which can prevent neuroinflammatory pathways contributing to AD (Fig. 3). Phytochemicals found naturally have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. Polyphenolic compounds are one in this broad category. Some of the compounds include vitamin E, vitamin C, Curcumin, catechin and resveratrol. It has been seen in various studies that nutraceuticals containing these compounds act as pro-oxidants rather than anti-oxidants. So the exact actions of these nutraceuticals are still unclear and investigations are still going on (Sawikr et al. 2017).\n\nAnti-oxidant nutrients repress the synthesis of TNF-α, IL-6 and NO by the activated microglia in a fixation subordinate way. Vitamin E gives neuro-protection by lessening\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFig. 3 Neuroinflammatory pathways and drugs targeting neuroinflammation. Figure 3 shows that due to dysregulation of various pathways in  brain  and  periphery  leads  to  hyperactivation  of  Glial  cells  and other  inflammatory  cells  in  the  brain  which  contributes  to  neuroinflammatory pathway of AD. Drugs like PPARγ agonists, COX inhibitors,  vitamin  E,  vitamin  C,  curcumin  and  catechin  act  via  various mechanisms to reduce the neuroinflammatory pathways thus prevent the progression of AD\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTNF-α along with NO production and it decreases the LPS-instigated increment in free radicals and IL-6 in microglia. Polyphenolic compounds like flavonoids and Vitamin C may hinder age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Flavonoids, that are available in day to day dietary products, ensure survival and wellbeing of neuronal cells by decreasing oxidation of proteins, restraining of JNK and p38 pathways and forestalling production of free radicals (Shabab et al. 2017).\n\nPioglitazone acts as Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonist; it changes the M1 state of microglia to M2 state which increases the phagocytosis of deposited Aβ. PPARγ agonists also reduce the synthesis of IL-1β inflammatory cytokines. Transhinone I is an inhibitor of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and nitric oxide and subsequently inhibits NFκB pathway in microglia. Gastrodin inhibits MAPK pathway and NFκB resulting in reduction of pro-inflammatory mediators, cytokines and interleukins. Resveratrol also inhibits NFκB, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and MAPK by mTOR pathway. Trans-cinnamaldehyde inhibits and degrades iNOS which inhibits ERK1/2/MEK pathways and reduce production of NO. Glatiramer acetate reduces the release of TNF-α from microglial cells but it does not have any profound effect in the synthesis of NO (Thawkar and Kaur 2019) (Table.1).",

In preclinical trials on rat models indomethacin reduced the levels of inflammatory molecules like TNFα and IL1β in the hippocampus region of the brain (Rawat et al. 2019). Indomethacin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug which acts as PPARγ activator that results in decreased activity of BACE1 reducing the production of Aβ from APP (Deardorff and Grossberg, 2017). The results are although negative in some studies as this drug failed to slow down the progression of AD (de Jong et al. 2008) however some recent studies revealed neuroprotective action of indomethacin and improvement in cognitive decline in AD (Ali et al. 2019). More research needs to be done to establish a definitive role of indomethacin in AD treatment.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In animal models simufilam has been proven to reduce inflammation and tau phosphorylation via binding filamin thus preventing binding of Aβ42 α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (Pleen and Townley 2021). PTI-125 binds to altered filamin A (FLNA) and restores its normal structure, improves receptor and synaptic functions and reduces its linkage with α7nAChR/ TLR4 downstream pathologies which leads to increase in hyperphosphorylated tau levels and increased release of inflammatory mediators respectively (Wang et al. 2017).",

Candesartan being an angiotensin receptor blocker has a potential to prevent the AT2R binding. Stress stimuli such as cold, predator exposure activate release of RAS and Ang II. In familial AD mice models candesartan reduced nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase levels. It also reduced the hyperactivation of microglia in the hippocampal region of AD mice brains (Torika et al. 2018). Candesartan potentially decrease the activity of angiotensin I receptor which contributes in the modulation of inflammation in AD (Trofimiuk et al. 2018).\n\n|   S.

        "content": "AD is a rapidly progressing disorder contributing to neurodegeneration. Many hypotheses have been made regarding the pathophysiology of the disease including mainly tau hypothesis and amyloid β hypothesis. But due to the involvement of several factors in the pathogenesis of the disease complete cure is still on the urge of development. Many evidences support the involvement of brain inflammation in the development of the disease. The major cells involved in the neuroinflammation process in the brain are glial cells including microglia and astrocytes. Other cells involved in neuroinflammation are oligodendrocytes, pericytes and neurons. In AD brains these cells become\n\nhyperactive and potentiate the release of inflammatory mediators like cytokines, chemokines, interferons and interleukins which get accumulated around senile plaques in the brain and contribute to neuroinflammation.\n\nVarious inflammatory molecules are involved in the progression of AD. Interleukins promotes the activation of T-lymphocytes mediated toxicity, increase the activity of macrophages and neutrophils. Inflammatory cytokines are released from glial cells and are of two types, proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory. Chemokines may powerfully direct microglial relocation and enlistment of astrocytes to the site of neuroinflammation, preferring the degree of local aggravation of inflammation. Other inflammatory molecules are neutrophils and interferons.\n\nPathways like NFκB, MAPK, Akt/mTOR, p38, COX and nitric oxide pathways are involved in the release of inflammatory molecules from microglia by activating it or potentiating M1 state of microglia. AMPK pathway generally ameliorates the inflammatory response by inhibiting mTOR pathway. Anti-inflammatory molecules like minocycline are employed for reducing Aβ and tau pathologies by mitigating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from glial cells. Inhibition of iNOS and Cox-2 is also considered effective in ameliorating neuroinflammation in AD patients. Other anti-inflammatory molecules are curcumin, catechin, Vitamin E and Vitamin C. Celecoxib a cox-2 selective inhibitor, also ameliorates inflammation in brain. Pioglitazone a PPARγ agonist, changes the M1 state of microglia to M2 state which increases the phagocytosis of deposited Aβ. PPARγ agonists also reduce the synthesis of IL-1β inflammatory cytokines. Many drugs targeting neuroinflammation inducing pathways are under different phases of clinical trials. As there is a need of development of complete cure for Alzheimer's disease, focusing neuroinflammation pathways can come out as effective treatment for the disease.\n\nAuthor contributions RD wrote the manuscript, PS wrote the manuscript, BM design and edited manuscript, AB edited manuscript, DHR design, wrote and edited Manuscript.\n\nFunding None.\n\nAvailability of data and material Not applicable.",

        "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disorder with dementia, accounting for approximately 70% of the all cases. Currently, 5.8 million people in the U.S. are living with AD and by 2050 this number is expected to double resulting in a significant socioeconomic burden. Despite intensive research, the exact mechanisms that trigger AD are still not known and at the present there is no cure for it. In recent years, many signaling pathways associated with AD neuropathology have been explored as possible candidate targets for the treatment of this condition including glycogen synthase kinase-3 β (GSK3β ). GSK3β is considered a key player in AD pathophysiology since dysregulation of this kinase influences all the major hallmarks of the disease including: tau phosphorylation, amyloidβ production, memory, neurogenesis and synaptic function. The present review summarizes the current understanding of the GSK3β neurobiology with particular emphasis on its effects on specific signaling pathways associated with AD pathophysiology. Moreover, it discusses the feasibility of targeting GSK3β for AD treatment and provides a summary of the current research effort to develop GSK3β inhibitors in preclinical and clinical studies.",

        "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of age-related neurodegenerative disorder with dementia. Currently, the estimated number of people living with this disease in the United Sates is 5.8 million, a number projected to increase rapidly in the coming years due to the aging of the baby-boomer generation and the lack of a cure [1]. In fact, the number of Americans age 65 and older is predicted to double from 52 million in 2018 to 95 million by 2060 representing a potentially substantial social and economic burden for the future society [1,2].\n\nCorrespondence to: Domenico Praticò, MD, 3500 North Broad Street, MERB, suite 1160, Philadelphia, PA 19140, Tel: 215-707-9380, Fax: 215-707-2746, praticod@temple.edu.\n\nPublisher's Disclaimer: This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.

Early symptoms include difficulty recalling recent conversations, names or events. With the progression of the pathology, patients develop impaired communication skills, confusion, behavioral changes, poor judgment and often experience passiveness and depression [1,3]. The pathological hallmarks of this disorder are extracellular accumulation of amyloidβ (A β ) plaques composed of A β peptides, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed by hyperphosphorylated tau protein, brain inflammation and atrophy. These changes are thought to begin years before the clinical symptoms are noticeable [1, 3]. With the exception of the familial form which is the result of mutations on specific genes such as the A β precursor protein (APP), the presenilin 1 (PS1) and PS2 and which only account for approximately 2-4% of the total cases, AD is mainly a sporadic disorder whose etiology is currently unknown [4]. In fact, despite intensive research, the mechanisms responsible for A β accumulation and NFTs formation and deposition are not understood and there is not effective treatment for this condition. For this reason, in the past years several signaling pathways relevant to some of the pathophysiological processes have been investigated and evaluated as possible targets of novel therapeutic approaches for AD treatment.\n\nGlycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) is a ubiquitously expressed and constitutively active serine-threonine kinase involved in the regulation of many key cell biology pathways, some of which have been also implicated in neurodegeneration. There are two isoforms of GSK3, GSK3α and GSK3β encoded by two different genes [5]. In the central nervous system (CNS), GSK3β is the most abundant and its expression levels are known to increase with age [6]. GSK3β is found hyperactive in the brain of AD patients and compelling evidence supports its contribution to AD pathology by distinct mechanisms [7]. Dysregulation of this kinase have been observed to affect both A β and tau metabolism and toxicity in vitro and in vivo AD models. Additionally, GSK3β activity has been linked to memory consolidation, neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, long term potentiation and inflammation (Figure 1) [8].\n\nGiven the relevance of GSK3β signaling to the pathophysiology of AD, the therapeutic potential of its inhibition has been widely investigated in preclinical and clinical studies. This review will focus on GSK3β physiological function, current data regarding its aberrant activity in AD, and the evidence supporting the beneficial effect of GSK3β modulation as therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD.",

        "content": "GSK3 is a kinase that phosphorylates serine and threonine sites of a variety of substrates [9]. It was originally discovered in the 1980s and identified as one of the kinases that modulates glycogen synthase activity through phosphorylation leading to its inhibition [10]. Extracted from the rabbit skeletal muscle [10], GSK3 has been implicated in the regulation of several vital cellular processes including cell apoptosis, differentiation, proliferation and the microtubule morphology [11]. GSK3 is constitutively active and abundantly expressed in the CNS [9]. As the research on GSK3 has expanded greatly following its discovery, two isozymes have been identified, GSK3α and GSK3β , which although are coded by different genes on chromosomes 19 and 3 share a striking 98% similarity in structure [12]. Contrary to their similar structure, these isozymes are known to act on different substrates [13]. In\n\nfact, while in-vivo studies demonstrate that the complete elimination of GSK3β can be sufficient to cause death in embryo [14], GSK3α genetic deletion is found to have no significant impact on survival [15].\n\nAlthough, constitutively active, GSK3β function can be regulated by phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation on different sites. For instance, auto-phosphorylation on tyrosine-279/216 mediates GSK3β activation, while phosphorylation on serine sites 21/9 by AKT, protein kinase A and B (PKA-PKB) in the N-terminal which leads to its inhibition [16]. Moreover, the phosphate groups added to GSK3β during phosphorylation are removed by protein phosphatase PP2A resulting in GSK3β reactivation (Figure 2) [17]. From postmortem studies to in-vivo and in-vitro studies, in recent years this kinase has emerged as a potentially active player in several mechanisms relevant to neurodegeneration [18-20].",

        "content": "In vitro and in vivo evidence has shown that GSK3β activation is involved in A β formation and accumulation in the AD brain by modulating the cleavage of APP. In the brain two different pathways, non-amyloidogenic and amyloidogenic, are involved in the cleavage of APP through the action of different proteases [21]. The non-amyloidogenic cleavage of APP is done by α -secretase complex consisting of ADAM-10 and -17 and the γ -secretase. The cleavage done by α -secretase produces peptides that are easily degraded [22]. By contrast, in the amyloidogenic pathway APP is initially cleaved by the β -secretase (BACE-1) enzyme followed by the γ -secretase complex processing which causes the generation of A β peptides, which tend to fibrilize and oligomerize and eventually accumulate as A β deposits in the AD brain. Previous studies have identified APP and PS1, one of the catalytic components of γ -secretase complex [21], as GSK3β substrates, suggesting that APP cleavage and PS1 function are affected by elevated GSK3β activity causing higher A β production and subsequent deposition in the AD brain (Figure 3) [23,24].\n\nSome studies exploring the PS1 and GSK3β relationship suggest that GSK3β overactivation alters the function of PS1 as well its localization in the CNS [24]. PS1 is localized in Golgi membranes, endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane. This gene product is associated with N-cadherin/beta-catenin which together forms a synaptic trimeric complex consisting of serine residues that are subject to GSK3β phosphorylation. Over-activated GSK3β can downregulate the efficiency of the PS1/N-cadherin/beta-catenin complex causing deficiencies in synaptic and neuronal viability that leads to AD pathology [24]. Involvement of GSK3β in plaque formation has been also linked to BACE1 over-activation. Studies exploring the connection between GSK3β and BACE1 revealed that GSK3β overactivation or overexpression promotes BACE1 enzymatic cleavage of APP. Moreover, BACE1 expression has been shown to be mediated by GSK3β , however this event requires NFK-beta signaling in order for BACE1 transcription to take place [16]. Studies showed that both BACE1 and NFKβ expression are upregulated in AD patients and that NFKβ regulates the GSK3β -induced transcription of BACE1 through manipulation of the cisacting p65-binding promoter causing abnormal A β production (Figure3) [16, 25]. In support of these observations, the inhibition of GSK3β in APP mutant cell lines has proven to be an\n\neffective way to reduce the BACE1 cleavage of APP, which then result in a significant decrease of both A β 40-42 peptide levels [26,27].\n\nBeside the direct effect on APP, GSK3β activity can also induce A β pathology via disruption of the insulin signaling pathway. In vivo studies done using insulin-deficient mice models have revealed a positive correlation between A β and GSK3β levels [28]. Additionally, insulin degrading enzyme protein (IDE), a major player for A β degradation, has also been identified to be negatively correlated with GSK3β levels in diabetic mice [28]. Moreover, other findings suggest that brain tissues of insulin deficient rodent models show increased GSK3β and A β levels while IDE is significantly down-regulated [29-31].\n\nInterestingly, some studies have proposed a feedback loop interaction between A β and GSK3β activation in certain pathways that may ultimately lead to tau hyperphosphorylation. Moreover, A β can disrupt the normal Wnt pathway activity that prevents Wnt from inhibiting the GSK3β [32], and directly activate GSK3β which will then promote tau phosphorylation [33]. Taken together these findings would support the hypothesis that GSK3β can be considered as the biological link for both AD neuropathologies (i.e., A β and tau) [21].",

        "title": "GSK3 β and tau",
        "content": "Tau is a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) that is known to stabilize the microtubules by securing tubulin assembly [34]. Tau is encoded by the MAPT gene located on chromosome 17 and consists of six isoforms generated by alternative splicing [18,19]. Tau function and affinity for the microtubules mainly depends on its phosphorylation status. In AD, tau is hyper-phosphorylated and accumulates in the cytoplasm leading to microtubules disassembly, loss of neuronal integrity and eventually NFTs formation [35]. The majority of early studies on tau hyper-phosphorylation explored the kinase-phosphatase imbalance in the brain identifying GSK3β as a major tau kinase that may be involved in the development of the AD tau pathology [16, 20]. There are a considerable number of amino-acid residues of the tau protein that are subject to GSK3β phosphorylation [25]. The localization of the tau phosphorylation sites has also been of interest in AD research. GSK3β mediated phosphorylation of tau protein is seen in areas that are in close proximity to microtubule binding domains and their amino acid residues [36]. Protein-protein interactions are known to take place in these binding domains, therefore GSK3β induced tau phosphorylation is prone to self-aggregate in a toxic manner (Figure 3) [33]. One study using a transgenic Drosophila model successfully demonstrated that the aberrant upregulation of GSK3β positively correlates with accumulation of toxic tau aggregates [36]. Consistent with the invivo findings, in-vitro studies also show that human neuroblastoma cells display tau-filament aggregates resulting from GSK3β mediated phosphorylation strikingly similar to AD tau pathology [37]. For this reason, and because in vitro and in vivo studies have established that GSK3β inhibition restores hyper-phosphorylation of tau, the majority of drug discovery and development programs against tau pathology tends to target GSK3β activity [38-40].",

        "content": "Although current knowledge on sex differences for this kinase is insufficient, few studies have explored the effects of male and female hormones on GSK3 β activity and AD-related signaling pathways. In the brain of C57Bl6/J mice, activation of the 17 β -estradiol pathway has been associated with GSK3 β inactivation through serine-9 phosphorylation, and therefore with a significant reduction in A β accumulation along with decreases in hyperphosphorylated tau protein [41], suggesting that estrogen can lower GSK3 β initiated p-tau (phosphorylated tau) levels and APP processing. Moreover, 17 β -estradiol also prevented GSK3 β induced neuronal apoptosis by inducing phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K) and MAPK3 transduction in hippocampal slice culture [41]. Notably, another study exploring the changes in BACE and GSK3 β mRNA levels in AD patients reported a 7% downregulation in BACE mRNA in female post-mortem brain tissue compared to the male subjects but unfortunately, when GSK3 β was measured, its levels were below the limits of reliable detection and conclusion could not be drawn [42]. Thus, given all the current available data more work is needed to address this aspect of the GSK3 β neurobiology.",

        "title": "GSK3 β , synaptic plasticity and memory",
        "content": "Synaptic dysfunction is an early event in AD pathology [43]. The molecular mechanism underlying memory storage involves changes in synaptic strength including Long Term Potentiation (LTP), which defines a long-lasting increase of synaptic strength, and Long Term Depression (LTD), which is the opposite process [44]. Growing evidence indicates that GSK3β plays a critical role also in synaptic plasticity and memory formation (Figure 1) [43]. GSK3β is highly expressed in the hippocampus and although is mainly found in the cytosol, a fraction of this kinase is detected in synaptosomes, dendrites and spines [44,45]. Interestingly, GSK3β can also associate with the AMPA receptor and act like a key regulator of the balance between LTP and LTD [43]. In fact, GSK3β phosphorylation at the inhibitory Ser9 site is known to increase upon induction of LTP in the dentate gyrus (DG) and in the CA1 region of the hippocampus [45]. Overactivation of GSK3β instead, impairs LTP and promotes the NMDA receptor-dependent LTD [43]. Consistent with this observation, transgenic mice conditionally overexpressing GSK-3 β display impaired LTP and significant deficits in hippocampus-dependent spatial and fear memory formation [43].\n\nFurthermore, GSK3β inhibition enables stabilization of β -catenin which would be otherwise degraded by the proteasome following GSK3β phosphorylation [46]. β -catenin present at both pre- and postsynaptic terminals associates with the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin and regulate cell adhesion and influence synaptic size and strength [47-48]. Downregulation of the β -catenin signaling pathway due to increase GSK3β activity has been observed in AD brains and implicated in the pathophysiology of learning and memory deficits [50,51]. Given the pivotal role of GSK3β in the regulation of these processes, reduction of its activity obtained via both genetic and pharmacologic approach has been extensively explored and has been reported to rescue cognitive and memory deficits in several animal models of AD [8]. For example, the GSK3β inhibitor indirubin-3'monoxime rescued impairments in the Morris water maze task and, attenuated A β production and tau hyperphosphorylation in the APP/Presenilin-1 double transgenic mice [52]. The GSK3β inhibitor 2-methyl-5-(3-{4-[(S)-methylsulfinyl]phenyl}-1-benzofuran-5-\n\nyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (MMBO) ameliorated impairments in the Y-maze and the novel object recognition test in 3xTg mice [53]. Moreover, 5XFAD mice treated with the selective GSK3β inhibitor L803-mts had improved contextual fear memory in association with lower A β peptide levels [54].",

        "content": "GSK3β has also been reported to suppress adult hippocampal neurogenesis and to induce neuronal death in the neurogenic niche of dentate gyrus (DG) (Figure 1) [55]. Neurogenesis is a dynamic process required for memory consolidation and pattern separation and is altered in the CNS of AD patients and animal models of the disease [56,57]. In favor of the hypothesis of GSK3β as an important regulator of adult neurogenesis, transgenic mice overexpressing this kinase display reduction in proliferation and maturation of new functional DG neurons and significant memory impairments. This depletion of neurogenesis is also associated with activation of microglia which further promotes degeneration [56,58]. Thus, it seems pretty intuitive that, inactivation of this enzyme could be extremely beneficial in order to promote the birth of new functional neurons and booster memory in neuropathology with impaired neurogenesis like AD. In vitro and in vivo data seem to support this hypothesis. GSK3β inhibition was demonstrated to enhance proliferation, migration, and differentiation of neural stem cells in primary neurosphere cultures in vitro. Moreover, its inhibition in vivo with the NP03112 compound (tideglusib) was shown to promote neural stem cells proliferation and differentiation in the DG of the hippocampus in adult rats [59].",

        "title": "GSK3β and inflammation",
        "content": "Beside A β and tau aggregation, neuroinflammation is another major feature of the AD brain pathology (Figure 1) [60,61]. Extensive activation of microglia and astrocytes are observed around A β plaques and dystrophic neurites [62-64]. Once activated these cells release a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα ) which can promote neurotoxicity and contribute to neuronal death [65].\n\nRemarkably, GSK3β has been recently identified as an important regulator of the inflammatory response in microglia via multiple pathways. GSK-3 β activation has been demonstrated to promote production of IL-1, IL-6, TNFα but also to activate JNK-, STAT3/5- and NFκ B signaling [65]. Indeed, GSK-3 β can activate NFκ B by phosphorylation of the p65 subunit which results in further expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines [65]. In addition, the binding of GSK3β to STAT3 promotes STAT3 association with the IFN γ receptor-associated intracellular signaling complex which is required for IFN γ activation [66]. Few studies have also implicated GSK3β in the regulation of microglia migration. For example, treatment of BV-2 microglia cells with GSK3 inhibitors has been shown to significantly reduce microglia migration in vitro, in a transwell migration assay [67]. Given the substantial evidence for a proinflammatory action of GSK-3 β , its inhibition might not only reduce A β production and tau phosphorylation, but also exert anti-inflammatory effects in the AD brain.",

        "content": "Since GSK-3 β signaling has been strongly associated with several AD neuropathological features including tau phosphorylation, A β production, neurogenesis, memory and synaptic dysfunction, its inhibition has emerged as a potentially important therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD. Loss of function studies have been conducted on several AD mouse models and have been proven to be efficient in counteracting many aspects of AD-like pathologic phenotype [68,69] The mood stabilizing drug lithium has been shown to reduce phospho-tau and A β levels in several mouse models of AD and tauopathies [68-72]. Tideglusib, a non-ATP competitive GSK-3 β inhibitor lowered levels of tau phosphorylation, decreased A β deposition, astrocytes proliferation and ameliorated memory deficits in APPsw-tauvlw mice overexpressing human mutant APP [73,74]. Finally, brain infusion of a specific GSK3 inhibitor SB216763 confirmed the beneficial effect of the reduction of GSK3β activity in an AD model [75].\n\nAlthough GSK-3 is a highly conserved kinase only a few GSK-3 inhibitors (synthetic and non-synthetic) previously tested in the preclinical phase have reached clinical trials. Additionally, although some encouraging results in animal models, the fact that GSK3β is ubiquitously expressed and involved in several key cellular biological processes have raised many concerns and significant toxicological challenges for long-term treatment studies in both pre-clinical and clinical phase [76,77]. The first candidate for phase I of clinical trial as GSK3β inhibitor was AZD2558 [78]. This highly selective GSK3β inhibitor successfully reduced tau phosphorylation and gliosis in vitro and in vivo. However, the severity of the off target effects associated with its administration in vivo prevented this drug from being tested for chronic treatment of AD. A second attempt was made with AZD1080 previously validated for its capacity of reducing tau phosphorylation in vitro and in pre-clinic studies [78]. Unfortunately, chronic administration of this drug was also associated with significant sides effects and the phase I study was discontinued [78]. So far, only one GSK-3 inhibitor made it to phase II clinical trial for the treatment of AD and progressive supranuclear palsy, Tideglusib [79-81]. Tideglusib has been tested in two small Phase II clinical trials in patients with mild to moderate AD, which showed good tolerability but no significant clinical improvements [77].\n\nPilot clinical trials have been conducted with lithium chloride in patients with a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and AD. Lithium chloride, an FDA approved drug for the treatment of bipolar disorders [82], is a weak and unspecific GSK3β inhibitor. At therapeutic doses, it can reduce GSK3β activity by approximately 25% with no adverse effects [82]. Small clinical studies with this agent have shown some positive results including improved cognitive performance and reduction in tau phosphorylation [77] suggesting that lithium might hold potential as disease modifying therapy for AD.",

        "content": "In the past years, GSK3β has been recognized as an important key player in the AD pathogenesis. Since the initial discovery of GSK3β overexpression and overactivity in the CNS of AD patients, the role of this kinase has been extensively investigated in connection to tau and A β pathophysiology. As one of the main tau kinases, GSK3β promotes tau\n\nhyperphosphorylation and NFTs formation. Strong evidence has also pointed out that increased activity of GSK3β can induce A β formation through transcriptional regulation of BACE1 gene expression and through its regulatory function on PS1. Given the existence of sex differences in AD incidence, some studies have attempted to address the question on whether GSK3 β regulation is sexually dimorphic but all the current data available so far are not sufficient to conclude any significant gender-related effect on the activity of this kinase that could be relevant to the onset of development of AD pathology. In addition, recently GSK3β has been implicated in the modulation of synaptic plasticity, memory, neurogenesis and inflammation making GSK3β an excellent candidate as disease modifying agent for AD. However, current clinical research has failed so far to identify an effective and safe inhibitor of this kinase. GSK3β inhibition comes with many challenges related to its ubiquitous expression and multiple regulatory cellular functions. Future possible strategies aiming at bypassing the potentially serious off target effects should be to specifically direct GSK3β inhibition in the CNS and in the cells of interest. Therefore, given the promising preclinical studies, more research needs to be devoted to the development of selective and organ specific inhibitors that efficiently and safely regulate GSK3β activity in the CNS as a viable therapeutic approach to prevent or halt AD.",

        "content": "- GSK3β kinase increases with age and in AD pathology.\n- GSK3β dysregulation modulates A β production and accumulation in AD.\n- Hyperactive GSK3β promotes phosphorylation and formation of toxic tau species.\n- GSK3β activation is pro-inflammatory and impairs LTP, neurogenesis and memory.\n- GSK3β represents a good therapeutic target against AD.\n\nFigure 1. Role of GSK3β signaling in AD pathology.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSchematic representation of the potential involvement of GSK3β in different aspects and pathways relevant to the onset and development of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology. 1) GSK3β activation contributes to neurodegeneration by directly promoting tau hyperphosphorylation. Hyperphosphorylated tau dissociates from the microtubules leading to impaired axonal transport, NFTs formation, neuronal and synaptic dysfunction. 2) GSK3β promotes amyloid production and accumulation which induces apoptosis and neuronal damage in AD. 3) GSK3β also displays pro-inflammatory functions; it regulates the biological response of microglia, primary immune cells of the CNS and promotes production of inflammatory molecules. 4) Additionally, GSK3β play a critical role in the regulation of hippocampal neurogenesis, an important process that supports specific form of learning and memory and known to be affected in AD pathology. 5) Finally, GSK3β is also involved in synaptic plasticity and memory. Overactivation of this kinase has been linked to inhibition of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a mechanism required for memory formation.\n\nFigure 2. Regulation of GSK3β activity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGSK3β exists in an active and in inactive form depending on its phosphorylation status. Two families of enzymes modulate GSK3β activity: Serine/Threonine and Tyrosine kinases which attach phosphate groups to GSK3β and phosphatases which remove phosphate groups from GSK3β protein in response to external stimuli. In vitro and in vivo evidence have shown that, GSK3β activation is mediated by auto-phosphorylation on tyrosine-216, while its inhibition is mediated by phosphorylation on serine 9 by several kinases including: AKT, protein kinase A and B (PKA-PKB) and P90RSK. GSK3β phosphorylation on serine 389 by P38 MAPK kinase instead, has been shown to inhibit GSK3β . Additionally, the phosphate groups added to GSK3β during phosphorylation can be removed by protein phosphatase PP2A resulting in GSK3β re-activation.\n\nFigure 3. GSK3β interferes with A β and tau metabolism.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIncreased activity of GSK3β promotes A β formation via two distinct mechanisms: GSK3β induces BACE1 gene expression via upregulation of NFKβ signaling and modulates γ -secretase activity. 1) The human BACE1 promoter region contains two functional NF-kBbinding sites. In vitro and in vivo evidence have shown that GSK3β activation is involved in NFKβ /p65 nuclear translocation and binding to the BACE1 promoter sites, ultimately resulting in increased BACE1 protein levels and BACE1 mediated-APP processing and A β production. 2) GSK3β modulates γ -secretase activity by direct interaction and regulation of PS1 activity and cellular localization. Upon GSK3β phosphorylation, PS1 shows lower binding affinity for N-cadherin and reduced cell-surface expression which alter PS1/ γ -secretase substrate specificity.\n\nAdditionally, GSK3β is one of the major kinases involved in tau phosphorylation. The addition of a phosphate group on the specific Thr231 residue of tau protein leads to microtubules disassembly and promotes formation of tau oligomers and NFTs contributing to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration.",

        "content": "Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is characterised neuropathologically by amyloid β peptide plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. 1  Advances in understanding amyloid and tau pathology led to the development of biomarkers for presymptomatic and early diagnosis, 2  and to the accurate postmortem diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. 3-5  However, progress in treatment remains slow. Animal models have reinforced the link between toxic amyloid β and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) intermediates with cognitive decline, 1  emphasising the importance of early detection of atypical concentrations of these proteins through fluid or imaging biomarkers. 5  Pathological amyloid β and p-tau aggregates first appear in specific cortical and subcortical areas, 6  with tau pathology more closely linked to clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease than amyloid β deposition. 7\n\nCompared with the extensive research on Alzheimer's disease risk so far, less is known about the mechanisms underlying resistance and resilience to the disease. Two cases of autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease showcase these protective phenomena. 8,9  A carrier of the PSEN1 Glu280Ala mutation who was homozygous for the APOE3 Christchurch variant (also known as Arg136Ser and abbreviated throughout as APOE3Ch) had regionspecific resistance to tau pathology. 8,10  The other case was that of a PSEN1 Glu280Ala mutation carrier with a rare RELN gene variant (His3447Arg and referred to throughout as RELN-COLBOS). 9  In both cases, symptom onset was delayed by more than two decades compared with typical PSEN1 Glu280Ala carriers from the same Colombian kindred, who usually develop mild cognitive impairment by age 44 years and dementia by age 49 years. 11 These cases help distinguish resistance (a term that refers to the cellular or molecular processes that prevent or reduce pathology) from resilience (a term that refers to the capacity of certain individuals for maintaining cognitive functions despite having typical Alzheimer's disease pathology). 12\n\nIn this Review, we describe the evidence on protective genetic variants in Alzheimer's disease and evaluate how these findings could guide the development of novel treatment strategies aiming to slow or prevent disease progression by mimicking or boosting these natural defence mechanisms.",

        "title": "Protective genetic variants against sporadic Alzheimer's disease",
        "content": "Genome-wide association studies have allowed the discovery of several genetic variants that are protective against sporadic Alzheimer's disease, beyond the widely known APOE allele ε 2. 13-15  The development of geneticbased metrics seems crucial for identifying and monitoring individuals at high risk of sporadic Alzheimer's disease, and for selecting participants for clinical trials testing early-stage interventions. 16-18  Additionally, identification of resilience-associated variants can inform the development of diseasemodifying therapies by uncovering biological pathways involved in Alzheimer's disease progression (panel). 16,19\n\nAmong genetic risk factors, APOE remains the strongest and most prevalent risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease, comprising three major allelic variants: APOE ε 2, APOE ε 3, and APOE ε 4, with either a protective (APOE ε 2), physiologically neutral (APOE ε 3), or detrimental (APOE ε 4) effect on Alzheimer's disease pathology. 20  In sporadic Alzheimer's disease, the APOE ε 2 allele (which encodes ApoE2) is the most common protective variant, with an allele frequency estimated to be at 7% of the population worldwide, albeit with geographical variability. 21-23  People who carry APOE ε 2 have a 10-year delay in age of disease onset as compared with those who carry APOE ε 4, who have an age of onset between 63·8 years and 76·0 years for people who are homozygous for the ε 4 allele, and between 66·1 and 80·5 years for those who are heterozygous ( ε 3/ ε 4). 24,25\n\nIn 4-month-old APP/PS1/APOE4 mouse models of Alzheimer's disease pathology, the intracerebral injection of viral vectors expressing APOE ε 2 in the ventricles has been associated with reduced amyloid β plaque deposition in the cortex, decreased synaptic loss, and less microglial activation 2 months after injection, compared with vehicle control-treated mice. 26  In addition to APOE ε 2, other APOE variants have been linked to protective effects. Among them, two rare missense variants in APOE ε 3 (Val236Glu or ApoE3-Jacksonville) and APOE ε 4 (Arg251Gly) have been reported to substantially lower the risk of Alzheimer's disease by more than 60% and more than 50%, respectively. 27,28  The APOE ε 4 allele, conversely, is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. 20 APOE ε 4 knockout has therefore been proposed as a therapeutic strategy. This hypothesis is supported by evidence showing that loss-of-function variants on APOE ε 4 are associated with Alzheimer's disease protection in human beings. 29  Lowered ApoE concentrations in a P301S/APOE ε 4 mouse model, by use of antisense oligonucleotides targeting APOE mRNA, were associated with reduced tauopathy, brain atrophy, inflammation, and synaptic loss. 30\n\nFindings from genome-wide association studies suggest an association between APOE and other genes, such as TMEM106B, in influencing Alzheimer's disease risk. 31  Specifically, a study with human samples found that TMEM106B, APOE, and amyloid β effects converge to alter myelination and lysosomal gene expression, whereas the TMEM rs1990621 variant has been associated with increased neuronal density. 32,33  Another key gene, TREM-2, is expressed in microglia. 34  This gene plays a crucial role in microglia proliferation, survival, migration, and phagocytosis. 35  In mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, TREM-2 haplodeficiency and deficiency can lead to reduced microglial clustering around amyloid β plaques, suggesting that TREM-2 is required for plaque-associated microglial responses. 36\n\nStimulating TREM-2 with agonistic antibodies could be a new therapeutic approach, as it can enhance microglial metabolism in several models of Alzheimer's disease. 37,38\n\nAdditionally, ABCA7 has been highlighted by genomics, transcriptomics, and methylomics approaches for its roles in amyloid β clearance via phagocytosis and in lipid metabolism by promoting the release of phospholipids and cholesterol. Several ABCA7 variants have been highlighted as protective, such as rs72973581 31  and Val1613Met, via a suggested gain-offunction mechanism. 39  Conversely, loss-of-function variants, such as rs4147929, have been associated with increased Alzheimer's disease risk in Icelandic populations (OR 2·12) and in European and US populations (combined OR 2·03). 40  These findings highlight ABCA7 as a possible genetic biomarker for Alzheimer's disease, warranting further investigation into its precise mechanisms 41  given that some variants have been associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease in specific populations, such as African American populations (rs11550680, rs14076058, rs567222111, rs10405305, and rs3764647) and Asian populations (rs3764650). 42\n\nAPP, which encodes the amyloid precursor protein, is central to Alzheimer's disease pathology. Successive cleavages of the amyloid precursor protein by β secretase and γ secretase produce amyloid β peptides that can aggregate and form plaques in the brain. In addition to APP, mutations in the PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes are generally associated with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease, as these genes encode the major enzymatic component of γ secretase. 43  In a set of wholegenome sequencing data from 1795 Icelandic individuals, the Ala673Thr mutation of the APP gene was found to be more prevalent in the healthy control population than in people with Alzheimer's disease. 44  This mutation also dampened amyloid β toxicity in a mouse model. 45\n\nEmerging evidence suggests that the PICALM gene modulates multiple pathways of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, including the processing of the amyloid precursor protein and amyloid β transcytosis, and substantially affects the progression of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease models. 46  The PICALM rs3851179A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has shown protective effects against Alzheimer's disease in populations from France, Italy, Lebanon, Spain, and Türkiye. 47\n\nIndependently from previous findings on genes such as PICALM and APP, multiple genome-wide association studies have reported the rs11136000 SNP of the CLU gene, encoding for clusterin, as a protective locus for Alzheimer's disease risk in European and US cohorts. This variant seems to upregulate clusterin concentrations in the temporal cortex of carriers. 48-50  Furthermore, a case-control association study in a cohort of Czech individuals 51  replicated this protective effect, also involving reduced aggregation of amyloid β . 48,51\n\nThe expression of another gene of interest, PLCG2, is increased in several brain regions in patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease compared with cognitively unimpaired participants. 52  Increased PLCG2 is also highly correlated with brain amyloid burden in both patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease and in Alzheimer's disease model mice. 53  Specifically, the Pro522Arg variant could reduce Alzheimer's disease progression\n\nby mitigating tau pathology in the presence of amyloid pathology by acting as a functional hypermorph, or in other words, a gain-of-function variant. 53,54  TREML2 rs3747742 and rs6915083 SNPs were associated with reduced Alzheimer's disease risk in separate studies. 55,56  TREML2 is involved in the regulation of inflammation by regulating microglia function. 57\n\nFinally, a study conducted in the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium, Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project, and UKB cohorts reported that two missense, potential loss-of-function variants in the fibronectin 1 (FN1) gene might protect against APOE ε 4mediated Alzheimer's disease pathology. In cognitively unimpaired individuals homozygous for APOE ε 4, brain expression showed statistically significantly lower FN1 deposition and reduced reactive gliosis compared with people with homozygous APOE ε 4 and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, fibronectin loss of function in zebrafish models can enhance gliovascular remodelling at the blood-brain barrier, increase microglial activity, and reduce gliosis. These findings suggest that FN1 could act as a downstream driver of APOE ε 4-mediated pathology and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. 58",

        "content": "In a Colombian woman carrying the PSEN1 Glu280Ala variant who was homozygous for the APOE3Ch variant, the onset of cognitive symptoms was delayed by more than 30 years, compared with typical carriers from the same kindred, who generally develop mild cognitive impairment around age 44 years and progress to dementia by age 49 years. 8  In this woman, PET imaging using  18 F flortaucipir as a tracer revealed an atypical pattern of tau accumulation, of reduced magnitude and confined primarily to the occipital cortex, with little involvement of medial temporal and other cortical regions. Postmortem analysis confirmed sparse tau neuropathology, with a higher concentration in posterior regions than in the frontal cortex. This analysis also showed homoeostatic astrocytes and minimal vascular pathology, even in the presence of an elevated amyloid burden. 8,59,60 Morphological analyses of her brain consistently confirmed the presence of a larger and more complex astroglia morphology and reduced vascular pathology, compared with PSEN1 Glu280Ala carriers without the APOE3Ch variant. Furthermore, the astrocyte distribution in the cortical layer II was very similar to that found in healthy brains, and low concentrations of p-tau were found in layers I-III of the frontal cortex, which possibly contributed to her cognitive resilience. 60  Heterozygous carriers of APOE3Ch and PSEN1 Glu280Ala from the same Colombian kindred, including both female and male individuals, have also been studied. These individuals showed a delay of approximately 5 years in the onset of mild cognitive impairment and 4 years in dementia onset compared with typical PSEN1 Glu280Ala carriers. A neuroimaging study in two APOE3Ch carriers revealed reduced tau deposition and relatively preserved brain metabolism compared with non-carriers, whereas postmortem analyses showed less amyloid-related vascular pathology in these two individuals than in APOE3Ch non-carriers. 60,61\n\nContrasting the protective effect observed in Colombian carriers, a study of a family from Spain reported a case of early-onset Alzheimer's disease at age 53 years in a male individual who was heterozygous for the APOE3Ch variant, and without any mutation causing Alzheimer's disease, whereas a female sibling with the same variant developed Alzheimer's disease at age 66 years. Postmortem analysis of the male carrier showed amyloid angiopathy and Lewy body copathology consistent with advanced Alzheimer's disease. 62  These findings suggest that APOE3Ch heterozygosity does not universally confer protection against Alzheimer's disease and highlight the complexity of gene-environment and gene-gene interactions.\n\nExperimental studies have examined the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of APOE3Ch, and findings suggest that this genetic variant reduces its interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans. 63  This reduced binding of ApoE3Ch to heparan sulphate proteoglycans appears to limit tau deposits in brain regions that are typically affected in Alzheimer's disease, such as the medial temporal lobe. 8,59  By interfering with this pathway, ApoE3Ch might help modulate downstream processes that drive neurodegeneration.\n\nNeurons obtained from induced human and mouse pluripotent stem cells carrying human APOE4 and either the homozygous or heterozygous Christchurch variant have also uncovered some potential mechanisms of neuroprotection. 64-66  Specifically, given that APOE4 is a established major risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease, 20  establishing whether the Christchurch variant could also protect in the presence of the APOE4 allele was crucial. Findings have confirmed that the homozygous APOE4Ch variant provided protection against tau pathology, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation, whereas heterozygotes showed a partial protection against neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, but not against tau pathology. 65  A novel antibody designed to bind to the heparin-binding domain of ApoE3 in the R136 region, the 7C11 antibody, has been tested in both APOE4 knock-in and MAPT P301S  transgenic murine models, showing reduced tau phosphorylation (p-tau S396) in the brains of systemically treated APOE4 knock-in mice, 67  and reduced tau pathology in the retina of MAPT P301S  mice. In murine models carrying APOE3Ch, positive effects on amyloid pathology, amyloidinduced tauopathy, and tau-driven neurodegeneration have been shown. 68  Additionally, improvements in microglial response and enhanced myeloid cell phagocytosis have been observed. 64  Despite these findings, the optimal balance between microglial activation and suppression remains uncertain.\n\nOverall, inhibiting the interaction between ApoE and heparan sulphate proteoglycans might serve as a promising therapeutic strategy that could affect tau aggregation and spreading. Additionally, this inhibition might influence the severity, progression, and clinical presentation of autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease by reducing ApoE-mediated neurotoxicity and tau hyperphosphorylation. Findings on APOE3Ch also support that the interaction between ApoE and heparan sulphate proteoglycans could serve as a promising therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease. 67\n\nA resilient male individual from the Colombian PSEN1 Glu280Ala kindred who remained cognitively unimpaired until his late 60s (more than 20 years after the expected age\n\nof dementia onset) was found to be a carrier of the rare RELN-COLBOS variant. 9 In vitro and in vivo molecular genetic studies found that Reelin-COLBOS statistically significantly increased the phosphorylation concentrations of phosphorylated disabled homolog 1 (DAB1) in neurons, possibly via the higher binding affinity of Reelin-COLBOS to heparan sulphate proteoglycans, thus favouring increased local concentrations of Reelin in the vicinity of the APOE receptors. To further validate the protective mechanism of RELNCOLBOS, a knock-in mouse model carrying the RELN-COLBOS variant homologous to the human variant confirmed a gain-of-function effect via increased phosphorylated DAB1 concentrations; this effect was associated with reduced tau pathology and preserved cognitive performance when these mice were crossed with a transgenic model of tau pathology. Interestingly, the mouse model also indicated a sexually dimorphic effect of the RELN-COLBOS variant, with statistically significantly increased phosphorylated DAB1 concentrations only in male mice.\n\nPostmortem examination of the resilient Colombian male carrier of the RELN-COLBOS variant showed severe Alzheimer's disease pathology despite having high neuronal density and low tau pathology in the entorhinal cortex, compared with other individuals from the same kindred. These findings further support the protective role of this RELN-COLBOS variant. 9  The unique characteristics of this example provide valuable insights, complemented by in vitro and animal studies, and support the role of Reelin in Alzheimer's disease resilience and as a potential therapeutic target that could be used to mimic the effect of RELN-COLBOS. 9  Physiologically, the glycoprotein Reelin, encoded by the RELN gene, has several important functions in the brain, such as regulating neuronal migration, dendritic growth and branching, dendritic spine formation, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. 69  Reelin promotes long-term potentiation in the hippocampus by activating ApoEr2 and VLDL receptors and their downstream signalling via Dab1, which strengthens NMDA receptor function. 70  Experimental models show that reduced Reelin signalling can worsen age-related learning and memory deficits when combined with Alzheimer's disease-related tau mutations. 71  Additionally, Reelin mitigates amyloid β toxicity and tau hyperphosphorylation, two hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, supporting its role in preserving cognitive function with ageing. 70  Other evidence suggests that Reelin signalling might contribute to cognitive resilience and potentially lower dementia risk. 69-71  Studies in mice have shown that the RELN gene provides protection against amyloid β toxicity, compared with the low RELN expression in conditional knock-out mouse models. 72  A study reporting a single-cell transcriptomics atlas identified vulnerable excitatory and inhibitory neurons that are depleted in specific brain regions in Alzheimer's disease, providing evidence that the Reelin signalling pathway influences their vulnerability. 73\n\nLowering Reelin in entorhinal cortex layer II neurons through microRNA-mediated knock down reduces intracellular amyloid β without affecting amyloid precursor proteins, which suggests a direct link between Reelin and intracellular amyloid β accumulation. 74  Impaired Reelin signalling through amyloid β peptide binding to Reelin, alterations in Reelin processing and glycosylation, or reduced formation of active Reelin homodimers correlates statistically with higher tau phosphorylation in cultures of primary neurons treated with amyloid β , in the lateral entorhinal cortex of rats aged 24 months with cognitive impairment, and in various mouse models of tauopathy. 75  Furthermore, Reelin overexpression can\n\nimprove memory and counter tau pathology in transgenic mouse models expressing human tau. 76  Patients with Alzheimer's disease have distinct Reelin proteolytic fragments in CSF, including an approximately 500 kDa Reelin species, and increased expression of genes of the Reelin pathway, highlighting its potential role in Alzheimer's disease. 77\n\nA longitudinal analysis of a cohort of individuals carrying the PSEN2 p.Asn141Ile mutation, causative of autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease usually by age 50 years, reported an individual with exceptional resilience in whom cognitive decline was delayed by almost 18 years. 78  This individual did not carry the RELN-COLBOS or APOE3Ch variants, and PET imaging showed less tau spreading compared with individuals with autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease. Genetic analyses revealed the presence of a rare variant in the MAPT gene (MAPT p.Tyr441His), encoding for tau. Although more studies are needed to validate the genetic variants conferring resilience in this individual, these findings validate the crucial role of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease progression. 78",

        "title": "Pathways for cognitive resilience and resistance to dementia",
        "content": "Understanding the pathways that contribute to resilience and resistance (table) to dementia requires a multifaceted, comprehensive approach that encompasses the study of genetic, cellular, and environmental factors. Notably, the identification of protective variants in the APOE and RELN genes, which appear to influence the onset of cognitive decline in individuals with autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease, suggests the existence of a crucial pathway for cognitive resilience. This pathway involves differential binding to heparan sulphate proteoglycans and ApoE receptors. 8,9  Specifically, ApoE3Ch and ApoE3Jacksonville bind less to heparan sulphate proteoglycans, compared with ApoE4, thus supporting their protective role. 8,27  Higher ApoE4 concentrations and other diseaserelevant heparin-binding proteins have been found in plasma isolated from individuals with Alzheimer's disease, compared with healthy control participants. 79  Conversely, the RELNCOLBOS variant seems to enhance binding to heparan sulphate proteoglycans via electrostatic interactions promoted by the presence of an additional arginine, thus leading to a gain of function. 9  This opposite binding affinity to heparan sulphate proteoglycans of ApoE3Ch and RELN-COLBOS aligns with different binding affinities to ApoE receptors, particularly LRP-8 (or ApoEr2) and the VLDL receptor. 80\n\nThe ApoE-Reelin pathway has been shown to play a crucial role in synaptic plasticity, memory formation, and the suppression of tau phosphorylation. At the cortical level, Reelin is secreted by GABAergic interneurons and binds to ApoEr2 and VLDL receptors. These receptors are mainly located in neurons involved in synaptic plasticity, such as the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus. 81  This binding leads to the activation of Src kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of DAB1. DAB1 phosphorylation is a key event of Reelin signalling that leads to the activation of several downstream pathways before its ubiquitination and degradation. One of these downstream pathways involves AKT activation, which leads to inhibition of pGSK3 β and results in reduced tau phosphorylation and downstream neuroprotection (figure 1). Furthermore, the observation of increased neuronal density in the entorhinal cortex of the carrier of the RELN-COLBOS variant, along with the fact that he was cognitively unimpaired, suggests\n\nthat a gain of function of Reelin contributes to preserved neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity, thus resulting in enhanced memory and protection from cognitive decline.\n\nTau hyperphosphorylation is crucial and correlates with cognitive impairment in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Given that the APOE ε 4 variant is a major risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease, and as the ApoE4 isoform interferes with the Reelin-ApoE pathway, a gain of function of this pathway could promote resilience against tau-induced neuropathology. 82  ApoE4 is known to antagonise Reelin-ApoE receptor binding more strongly than other isoforms, thus supporting the hypothesis that upregulation of the Reelin pathway might be a key mechanism of resilience. Upregulation of the Reelin pathway was linked to a reduction of tau pathology in a person carrying the PSEN1 Glu280Ala variant. 8,9\n\nThe interaction between Reelin and ApoE receptors plays a pivotal role in regulating synaptic plasticity, facilitating long-term potentiation, modulating ApoE receptor functions, and promoting presynaptic vesicle release, a process also regulated by phosphorylated DAB1. 80  The protective effects of the RELN-COLBOS variant regarding increased neuronal density in the resilient individual who carried an autosomal-dominant mutation suggest the existence of a preserved neuronal network linked to the Reelin pathway and its increased binding to heparan sulphate proteoglycans, followed by a preserved interaction with APOE receptors (VLDL receptor and ApoEr2), and the consequent intraneuronal upregulation of DAB1 concentrations. 69  ApoE3Ch binds with stronger affinity to neurotoxic tau than ApoE3, thus blocking tau spreading and subsequent neurotoxicity both in culture and in two different animal models, 5xFAD and P301S transgenic mice. 83  These findings strongly suggest that multiple mechanisms contribute to neuroprotection in people who carry these protective variants.\n\nOn a cellular level, another possible hallmark of resilience could be the presence of abundant RORB-positive excitatory neurons, identified as susceptible to Alzheimer's disease pathology, 84  and detected by snRNA sequencing in p-tau-protected areas, such as the frontal cortex, of the autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease APOE3Ch carrier. 10  The high neuronal density of layer II pyramidal neurons in the entorhinal cortex of the individual with RELN-COLBOS autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease suggested the survival of neurons that are usually vulnerable by Alzheimer's disease pathology. 9  Reelin-positive neurons were identified as vulnerable in Alzheimer's disease in a study using snRNA sequencing in several cortical areas of human brains of individuals ranging from 75 years to more than 90 years of age. 73  Thus, the discovery of genetic variants that confer resistance or resilience to Alzheimer's disease and the identification of the specific cell populations that benefit from these protective traits present a valuable opportunity to develop treatments promoting the survival of such cells.",

        "title": "Neuroinflammation",
        "content": "Gliosis and neuroinflammation are recognised contributors to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. 85  The protective mechanisms offered by the APOE3Ch and RELNCOLBOS variants suggest that the Reelin-ApoE pathway not only affects neurons but also modulates glial cells, such as microglia and astrocytes. On the basis of clinical observations in the APOE3Ch 8  and RELN-COLBOS 9  protected cases, these pathways are\n\nthought to have a crucial contribution to the preserved metabolic activity in brains resilient to Alzheimer's disease pathology, as measured by fluorodeoxyglucose PET (figure 2).\n\nRNA-sequencing analyses of the APOE3Ch carrier compared with non-protected PSEN1 Glu280Ala carriers have shown that ApoE3Ch elevates concentrations of the ApoE receptor LRP-1 in astrocytes in the frontal cortex, hinting at a potential resilience mechanism tied to the upregulation of LRP-1. 59  Furthermore, studies using transgenic mouse models indicate that APOE3Ch has a direct effect on microglia that results in enhanced clustering and activation, and ultimately leads to improved amyloid β clearance and reduced tau spreading. 64  Conversely, microglial ApoE4 has been shown to impair the microglial response to neurodegeneration 64  and to reduce capacity for phagocytosis and response to inflammation, 86  thus explaining its detrimental role in Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, ApoE4 negatively affects the induction of the neurodegenerative microglia phenotype, which is associated with neuroprotection. In Alzheimer's disease models, the deletion of microglial ApoE4 restores the neurodegenerative microglia phenotype and reduces pathology, suggesting a detrimental role of ApoE4 in microglial function. 86  In contrast to the effects of ApoE4 in lipid metabolism and microglial activation, microglia expressing the protective variant ApoE2 have been reported to do a better clearance of pathological proteins such as amyloid β , thus strengthening the role of the ApoE pathways in Alzheimer's disease. 86\n\nThe interaction between ApoE and TREM-2 is crucial for optimal microglial function. Studies have indicated that TREM-2-mediated microglial activation enhances the beneficial effects of ApoE3, whereas deficiency of TREM-2 exacerbates the detrimental effects of ApoE4 on aberrant microglia activation. 87  Moreover, Reelin is thought to influence the differentiation of astrocytic morphology and molecular profiles according to neuronal layers via DAB1 signalling, thus ensuring their proper function. 88  Reelin might modulate the phagocytic response of microglia via ApoEr2-dependent and VLDL receptor-dependent pathways. 89  The unique neuronal density pattern seen in the RELN-COLBOS protected individual could be also interpreted as a result of the homoeostatic environment associated with a particular glial profile.\n\nPreserved dendritic spine morphology has been reported in a cohort of cognitively unimpaired individuals with postmortem hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology (ie, individuals without dementia but with Alzheimer's disease neuropathology), 90 suggesting that improved synaptic functions might mitigate tau phosphorylation and spreading. Reduced tau phosphorylation and misfolding into toxic aggregates correlate with cognitive resilience. 91  A study validated that oligomeric tau is cleared from synapses in individuals without dementia but with Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, as compared with synapses of people with sporadic Alzheimer's disease. 91  Altogether, these findings confirm the crucial role in both resilience and resistance of the pathways that contribute to low concentrations of neurotoxic tau species and preserve synaptic integrity.\n\nAdditionally, TREM-2-driven phagocytic activity is enhanced in individuals without dementia but with Alzheimer's disease neuropathology compared with non-protected individuals with Alzheimer's disease, which aids in the maintenance of synaptic resilience.\n\nThese individuals have preserved axonal and dendritic structures near amyloid β plaques, that are known hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (figure 3). This preservation is associated with elevated TREM-2 expression and activity, suggesting that TREM-2 plays a protective role against synaptic loss and cognitive decline. 92",

        "content": "Alzheimer's disease is a heterogeneous disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Few disease-modifying treatments are available, and those that are available can cause substantial side-effects. In this Review, we have covered recent findings on protective variants against both sporadic and autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease (table), with a particular focus on the variants identified in families carrying the autosomal-dominant PSEN1 Glu280Ala mutation. Notably, individuals with the APOE3Ch or the RELNCOLBOS variants had a delay in cognitive decline of almost three decades, underscoring the therapeutic potential of mapping the downstream pathways responsible for their protection.\n\nIndividuals who carry the APOE3Ch or the RELN-COLBOS variants but without dementia, and with Alzheimer's disease neuropathology have unique protective mechanisms against either familial or sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease. Despite differing genetic and molecular backgrounds, these individuals share common biological traits that contribute to their protection against Alzheimer's disease pathology, including preserved synaptic integrity, reduced tau pathology, and lower concentrations of neuro-inflammatory markers. These shared traits suggest promising therapeutic targets for developing interventions that enhance brain resilience and slow or prevent cognitive decline. Furthermore, each individual case presents a distinctive pathological profile: APOE3Ch reflects a case of resistance, given the reduced Alzheimer's pathology and preserved cognition, whereas RELN-COLBOS is characterised by resilience. This distinction implies that there might be multiple strategies of protection against Alzheimer's disease, which might converge on shared mechanisms. Although more research is needed to fully elucidate the molecular pathways and develop targeted treatments, these findings support the hypothesis that resilience to Alzheimer's disease is linked to the Reelin-ApoE pathway.",

        "content": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involve the DNA analysis of a large population, which enables the identification of associations between genetic variants (ie, single-nucleotide polymorphisms) and specific diseases or phenotypes. The identification of genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative diseases is feasible through GWAS. Analyses focused on families with a particular family history of a disease are referred to as GWAX or GWAS by proxy. 13-15\n\nPolygenic analysis involves the study of the effects of multiple genetic variants across the genome on different diseases. Polygenic risk scores are calculated as the weighted sum of risk alleles identified by a discovery GWAS. 17  The resulting polygenic risk score is a parameter that allows the establishment of the genetic predisposition to a specific disease or phenotype. 18\n\nA polygenic resilience score represents the weighted sum of alleles associated with the absence of a condition in individuals with high polygenic risk scores. 18  Polygenic resilience score is a novel genetic measure that quantifies an individual's potential to resist or overcome the genetic risk for complex disorders, such as schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease. The identification of resilience-associated variants can inform the development of disease-modifying therapies by uncovering biological pathways involved in Alzheimer's disease progression. 16\n\nGWAS and polygenic analyses allow identification of common genomic loci that confer either risk or resilience to sporadic Alzheimer's disease. 13-15  The novel development of polygenic risk and polygenic resilience scores is crucial for clinical studies evaluating disease-modifying and prophylactic interventions against Alzheimer's disease. A study from 2020 used data from four publicly available clinical cohorts (ACT, ROSMAP, ADNI, and A4) to investigate the genetic covariances between the participants' cognitive resilience, given their amyloid burden, and 67 other complex traits, including educational attainment, mental health, and various physiological characteristics. 14  The authors identified important genetic correlations between resilience phenotypes and traits, such as education, smoking behaviour, and neuropsychiatric conditions. 14  Furthermore, a large GWAS involving 111 326 clinically diagnosed individuals with Alzheimer's disease and 677 663 healthy control participants contributed to the discovery of 42 new risk loci. 15  Collectively, evidence from these large-scale studies support that amyloid plaque, neurofibrillary tangle formation, cholesterol metabolism, endocytosis, phagocytosis, and innate immune system function are the pathways influencing Alzheimer's disease risk. 15,19",

        "content": "We searched the National Institute on Aging database, the ALZFORUM databases (including, AlzBiomarker, AlzRisk), and PubMed between Jan 1, 2019 and March 1, 2025 for studies describing protective genetic variants against sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease, using the keywords 'Alzheimer's disease' and 'resilience', 'resistance', 'Christchurch', 'Reelin', 'RELN-COLBOS', 'genetic risk factors', 'pathology', 'protect', 'protective', 'variant', 'GWAS', 'TREM-2', 'pathways', and 'HSPG'. Additionally, our selection criteria aimed to help us identify current challenges in developing effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease and elucidating pathways and genetic variants that promote resilience or resistance against the disease. We omitted studies where the full text was unavailable, preventing a thorough evaluation of their quality and relevance to the scope of this Review. Only articles published in English were consulted.\n\nFigure 1: The ApoE-Reelin pathway of resilience in neurons\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe intraneuronal pathway is activated upon interaction between Reelin or ApoE and heparan sulphate proteoglycans, followed by binding to the ApoE receptor. Once the Reelin-ApoE receptor complex is internalised, the rapid phosphorylation of DAB1 leads to AKT activation and subsequent inhibition of GSK3 β , thus resulting in reduced tau phosphorylation. pDAB1 activity is controlled by fast ubiquitination and degradation. HSPG=heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Figure created with BioRender.com.\n\nFigure 2: Differences between individuals susceptible or resilient to Alzheimer's disease. (A) ApoE3 and Reelin variants contribute to maintain the homoeostatic balance between glia and neuronal transmission. In people with autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease or sporadic Alzheimer's disease, microglia, astrocytes, and synaptic transmission are severely affected. APOE4 contributes to impaired Reelin activity due to increased binding affinity to heparan sulphate proteoglycans, thus contributing to tau hyperphosphorylation. The effects of Alzheimer's disease-inducing pathological variants are counterbalanced by the presence of protective variants such as APOE3Ch. Reelin-COLBOS contributes to preserved microglia, astrocytes, and neuronal function thanks to up-regulated reelin activity and reduced tau phosphorylation. (B) Representative fluorodeoxyglucose PET scans of the brain of an individual with autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease (left) and the brain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof a Reelin-COLBOS resilient individual (right) showing that the metabolic activity of the brain is severely affected in the presence of Alzheimer's disease pathology, whereas in the presence of protective variants, metabolism is preserved.

Figure created with BioRender.com.\n\nFigure 3: The protective role of TREM-2 in microglia\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(A) Increased TREM-2 activity leads to preserved microglia activity, whereas the crosstalk of TREM-2 with ApoE leads to preserved astrocyte function, increased phagocytosis, and preserved neuronal activity in individuals with resilience. (B) The loss of function of TREM-2 activity leads to impaired microglia activity that, along with degenerating astrocytes, contributes to neurodegeneration in people with Alzheimer's disease.

        "content": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau undergoes abnormal post-translational modifications and aggregations. Impaired intracellular degradation pathways further exacerbate the accumulation of pathological tau. A new strategy - targeted protein degradation recently emerged as a modality in drug discovery where bifunctional molecules bring the target protein close to the degradation machinery to promote clearance. Since 2016, this strategy has been applied to tau pathologies and attracted broad interest in academia and the pharmaceutical industry. However, a systematic review of recent studies on tau degradation mechanisms is lacking. Here we review tau degradation mechanisms (the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosome pathway), their dysfunction in AD, and tau-targeted degraders, such as proteolysistargeting chimeras and autophagy-targeting chimeras. We emphasize the need for a continuous exploration of tau degradation mechanisms and provide a future perspective for developing tau-targeted degraders, encouraging researchers to work on new treatment options for AD patients.",

Multiple strategies have been applied to ameliorate tau pathology in AD, such as inhibiting tau expression, modulating tau post-translational modifications, inhibiting tau aggregation, and promoting tau degradation. 12,13 Mostof the tau-targeting therapies in clinical trials are immunotherapies, 13,14 but tau antibodies have limited effect intracellularly, where most of thepathologicaltauaccumulates. 15 Analternativestrategyforincreasing tau clearance is targeted protein degradation, 16 which promotes the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP) for tau degradation.

Therefore, in this review we summarize the main intracellular tau degradation pathways, UPS and ALP, their mechanisms, crosstalk, key proteins involved in these pathways, and their dysfunction in AD.

        "content": "UPS is a highly conserved intracellular mechanism that maintains protein homeostasis and eliminates damaged, misfolded, and mutated proteins in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. 18,19 UPS involves two steps: covalent attachment of multiple ubiquitin molecules to the protein substrate and subsequent degradation of the ubiquitinated protein by the proteasome complex. In the first step, the 76amino-acid-long protein ubiquitin is activated by a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) and then transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). Subsequently, the ubiquitin-E2 conjugate interacts with the ubiquitin ligase (E3), which recognizes the protein substrate and mediates the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to the protein substrate. 20 In the second step, ubiquitinated proteins are transported to the 26S pro-\n\nFIGURE 1 Tau degradation by ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Under normal conditions, tau is degraded by the 20S proteasome. After certain post-translational modifications (PTMs), tau is ubiquitinated by series E1/E2/E3 ubiquitin (Ub) transfer processes and delivered to the 26S proteasome for proteolysis into short peptides. Tau oligomers and filamentous aggregates can be disaggregated by the chaperone complex (Hsp70-Hsp110-JDPs) to monomeric tau. The 26S proteasome can also fragment filamentous aggregates and remove soluble oligomers, which is independent of its peptidase activity.

The ubiquitinated proteins can be recognized by intrinsic ubiquitin receptors of the proteasome or shuttle factors, such as p62/SQSTM1, that contain both a ubiquitin-associated domain and a domain that binds to the proteasome. 22",

        "content": "Tau, as a natively unfolded protein, is degraded by the ATP/ubiquitinindependent 20S proteasome under normal cell conditions 23,24 (Figure 1). When tau undergoes pathological modifications, such as hyperphosphorylation and truncation, it is degraded by the 26S proteasome instead of the 20S proteasome. 25 Hyperphosphorylated tau is ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (carboxyl terminus of the Hsc70-interacting protein) together with the E2 ubiquitinconjugating enzyme UbcH5, followed by UPS degradation via the 26S proteasome. 26,27 Tau fragments cleaved by caspase-2 at residues D65 and D421 are preferentially ubiquitinated by CHIP for degradation. 28 TauC3, the product of caspase cleavage at D421 in tau, is known to be a substrate of CHIP, and phosphorylation of TauC3 at a single residue (S416) is sufficient to weaken its interaction with CHIP. 29 Deletion of CHIP in mice leads to the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and caspase-3-cleaved tau species, 30 and overexpression of CHIP promotes the degradation of phosphorylated tau (p-tau). 31,32 Arecent study also showed that CHIP recognized a phosphorylation-dependent degron on tau, 33 although a former study revealed a multidomain dynamic interaction between CHIP and unmodified tau. 34 In addition, tau is a ubiquitinated substrate of other E3 ligases, for instance,\n\nTABLE 1 Dysfunction of tau-targeting E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases in AD patients.\n\n| Category             | Proteinname        | DysfunctioninAD

Meanwhile, ubiquitin molecules from ubiquitinated tau can be removed by deubiquitinating enzymes known as deubiquitinases (DUBs), such as ovarian-tumor domain cysteine protease DUB (OTUB1), 39 ubiquitinspecific protease (USP) 9, 40 USP10, 41 USP11, 42 USP13, 43 USP14, 44,45 and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) 46 (Table 1).\n\nInterestingly, Ye et al. performed in vitro assays showing that the 26S proteasome can remove soluble oligomers assembled from the monoubiquitinated tau aggregation domain (Tau K18 ) primarily by enabling their dissociation independent of its peptidase activity. 59 They also showed that full-length tau filamentous aggregates (up to ∼ 20 µm in length) are substrates of the 26S proteasome, which frag- ments them into small aggregates depending on proteasomal ATPase - but not proteolytic - activity. 60 These results amend the former view of proteasomes that can only target non-aggregated proteins. 61 Other indirect evidence comes from the development of PROTACs (summarized in Section 3), which are hetero-bifunctional molecules that bring the E3 ligase close to the protein of interest for ubiquitination. Silva et al. showed that their PROTACs (eg, QC-01-175) could reduce soluble and insoluble tau species in a UPS-dependent manner. 62,63 An intermediate step might be involved before the 26S proteasome degradation of tau aggregates as follows: disaggregation of ubiquitinated tau aggregates by chaperone Hsp70-Hsp110-JDPs (J domainproteins) complex. 64 However, this disaggregation step has not been investigated in their reported research. Taken together, the exact mechanism of tau degradation by UPS is still uncertain and requires further comprehensive investigations.",

        "content": "In human AD brains, there is a global increase of tau ubiquitylation. A total of 28 ubiquitylation sites have been identified for tau in AD brains, mainly located on its proline-rich domain and microtubulebinding region. 65,66 K6-, K11-, K48-, and K63-linked as well as linear (head-to-tail) polyubiquitin chains have been verified in paired helical filaments (PHFs) or NFTs. 67,68 In AD, tau-targeting E3 ligases and DUBs have been reported to be either upregulated 41,47,49 or downregulated, 48,50,55 and some of them are reported to colocalize with AD tau pathology (Table 1). For example, CHIP colocalizes with tau lesions in human patients with tauopathy, including AD. 27 Sahara et al. reported increased CHIP levels in the temporal cortices of human AD brains, and CHIP protein expression levels were inversely proportional to sarkosyl-insoluble PHF-tau levels. They suggested that increases in CHIP may protect against NFT formation at the early stage of AD. 47 Later, Ravalin et al. observed a striking loss in CHIP expression in the hippocampus of human AD tissue at Braak stages III and VI, representing AD middle and late stages, respectively. They also analyzed RNA sequencing data from the Allen Brain Atlas revealing that CHIP mRNA did not significantly change, suggesting that the observed loss of CHIP occurs post-transcriptionally. 48 Another E3 ligase, HRD1, colocalizes with p-tau, and its expression levels correlate negatively with p-tau accumulation in the hippocampal neurons of AD. 37,49 The ratio of hHrd1-positive neurons/astrocytes to total neurons/astrocytes is increased in the CA1 subfield in AD hippocampus compared with the age-matched controls. 49 In the cerebral cortex of AD patients, HRD1 protein levels in the 1% NP-40 detergentsoluble fraction were significantly decreased, 50 whereas they were increased in the insoluble fraction. 69 In addition, HRD1 mRNA showed a tendency to increase in AD compared with controls. 50 The DUB UCH-L1 colocalizes with hyperphosphorylated tau in NFTs 54 and is oxidatively modified in the AD brain. 55 UCH-L1 protein levels are significantly increased in the human AD hippocampus (1.31-fold) 56 but decreased in AD frontal cortex. 55 Specifically, there is a significant decrease in soluble UCH-L1 protein levels but an increasing trend of insoluble UCH-L1 levels in AD frontal cortex, 58 and soluble UCH-L1 protein levels are inversely proportional to NFTs numbers in AD frontal cortex. 55 A recent study also reported that UCH-L1 protein levels decreased in the cerebral cortex (superior frontal gyrus) of patients with late-onset sporadic AD. 57 Therefore, in different brain regions and stages of AD, the regulation of UPS might be different, and it is crucial to investigate whether these changes are due to gene expression, protein degradation, or aggregation.\n\nIn addition, proteasome activity is significantly impaired in human ADbrains (Braak stage VI), especially in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, 70 and straight gyrus. 71 However, this loss of proteasome activity is not associated with a decrease in proteasome protein expression, which suggests that the proteasome may be inhibited in AD by a post-translational modification. 70 Importantly, PHF isolated from AD brains and tau oligomers can inhibit proteasome activity. 71,72 In summary, UPS dysfunction leads to abnormal accumulation of tau, while pathological tau impairs UPS, forming a vicious circle for disease progression.",

It includes three major types, as follows: macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). 73 Macroautophagy is the most prevalent form, and during this process the cell forms a double-membrane sequestering compartment termed the phagophore, which matures into an autophagosome with intracellular material (eg, proteins and organelles) inside, and is then delivered to lysosomes for degradation. 74 Macroautophagy is inhibited by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and triggered by activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). 75 In microautophagy, cytoplasmic material is directly taken up by lysosomes and late endosomes by membrane protrusion and invagination. 76 In CMA, lysine-phenylalanine-glutamate-arginine-glutamine (KFERQ)-like motif-bearing proteins in complex with the chaperone heat shock cognate protein of 70 kDa (HSC 70) and co-chaperones are delivered to the lysosome surface and internalized into the lysosome through a multimeric complex of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP2A) for degradation. 77",

        "content": "Tau can be degraded by all three types of ALP (Figure 2). Selective macroautophagy can recognize protein aggregates and mediate their degradation, which is called 'aggrephagy.' 78 In aggrephagy, ubiquitinated tau is recognized by autophagy cargo receptors, such as p62/SQSTM1 (sequestosome1), 79,80 OPTN (optineurin), 80,81 NDP52/CALCOCO2 (nuclear domain 10 protein 52, calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 2), 82 NBR1 (neighbor of breast cancer 1 gene), 83 CCDC50 (coiled-coil domain containing 50), 84 and TAX1BP1 (trans-activating transcriptional regulatory protein of HTLV-1 [TAX1] binding protein 1). 85 These receptors contain not only a ubiquitinassociated domain to recognize ubiquitin chains on protein aggregates, but also an LC3-interacting region allowing for the binding of LC3 on the phagophore membrane, thereby allowing the recruitment of these protein aggregates to phagophores, eventually leading to degradation by the lysosome. Specifically, these autophagy cargo receptors target different forms of tau species in different conditions. The knocking out of p62/SQSTM1 in P301S mutant tau transgenic mice (line PS19) causes a significant accumulation of tau oligomers, suggesting the requirement of p62 to eliminate disease-related oligomeric tau species. 79 However, another study reported that p62/SQSTM1 predominantly degraded insoluble, but not soluble, mutant tau (P301L) in a seeding-based cellular assay and that overexpression of\n\n(A) Macroautophagy (Aggrephagy)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFIGURE 2 Tau degradation by the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP). ALP includes three major types: macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and microautophagy. (A) In one of the selective macroautophagy pathways (aggrephagy), ubiquitinated tau is recognized by autophagy cargo receptors, which can bind to LC3 on the phagophore membrane. This leads to the recruitment of tau to phagophores, followed by degradation in the lysosome. (B) In CMA, KFERQ-like motifs of tau are recognized by the HSC70 chaperone complex, delivered to the lysosomal surface, and internalized into the lysosome through a multimeric complex of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2A(LAMP2A)for degradation. (C) In selective endosomal microautophagy (eMI), KFERQ-like motifs of tau are recognized by the HSC70 chaperone complex, which can bind to the endosomal membrane via electrostatic interactions. The late endosomal membrane invaginates and sequesters tau into small microvesicles. Late endosomes can degrade tau directly in the endosomal lumen or upon fusion with autophagosomes/lysosomes.

Tau contains two such motifs in its Cterminal region: 336 QVEVK 340 and 347 KDRVQ 351 . 87 CMA and eMI efficiently degrade WT-unmodified tau monomer (hTau40), but tau mutations (A152T or P301L) or phosphorylation can reduce the degradation by CMA and eMI. 88 Under certain conditions, tau degradation can be rerouted from one type of autophagy to another. For example, tau mutation A152T blocks the degradation of tau by eMI, favors its rerouting toward macroautophagy degradation, and has a mild inhibitory effect on its degradation by CMA. 88 Tau acetylation has an inhibitory effect on CMA activity and reroutes tau degradation from CMA to macroautophagy and eMI. 89 Experimental CMA blockage favors rerouting of monomer and oligomers of acetylated tau toward late endosomes/multivesicular bodies by eMI, which could lead to extracellular release and cell-to-cell propagation of tau. 89\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTABLE 2 Dysfunction of tau-targeting autophagy cargo receptors in AD patients.\n\n| Proteinname    | DysfunctioninAD                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| p62/SQSTM1     | Colocalized with NFTs in ADparietal cortex (Braak stages VandVI). 101 Colocalized with p-tauandA β in ADtemporal cortex. 102 Decreased protein levels in ADfrontal cortex (Braak stages IV and VI). 103 Increased protein levels in ADtemporal cortex. 102,104,105 |\n| OPTN           | Not colocalized with tau inclusions. 106 Adecreasing trend of protein levels in ADtemporal lobe cortex. 106 Progressively increased accumulation in aggresomes in ADhippocampus(fromBraakIII/IV to Braak VI). 107                                                  |\n| NDP52/CALCOCO2 | Associate with p-tau (Ser262/Ser356 [12E8] or a Ser396/Ser404 [PHF1]) in the ADcerebral cortex. 82 Inversely proportional to p-tau in insoluble fractions. 82                                                                                                      |\n| NBR1           | Nochanges in total brain homogenates from AD. 108 Reduced protein levels in neurons and microglia, but increased protein levels in astrocytesinAD hippocampus (Braak III and IV). 108                                                                              |\n| CCDC50         | Nonereported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| TAX1BP1        | Noimmunoreactivity for TAX1BP1inNFTsinADhippocampusbyimmunohistochemistry. 85                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| CCT2           | Decreased gene expression levels in ADprefrontal cortex (GSE33000 database). 109                                                                                                                                                                                   |",

        "content": "Accumulating evidence shows that ALP is impaired in AD. 90,91 Autophagosomes and other prelysosomal autophagic vacuoles are massively accumulated in neocortical biopsies from human AD brains as observed by electron microscopy. 92 This accumulation in AD is due to transcriptional upregulation of autophagy and impaired clearance of autophagic vacuoles. 93-95 In neurons, autophagosomes are continuously generated at the distal ends of axons and dendrites and need to be transported retrogradely long distances to fuse with lysosomes near the cell body for degradation. In AD, the maturation of autophagolysosomes and their retrograde transport are impeded, which also leads to massive accumulation of autophagic vacuoles within impaired neurites. 96 CMA downregulation was revealed by analysis of a single-nucleus RNA sequencing dataset in the prefrontal cortex of AD patients. 97 This CMA inhibition starts early in AD, becomes more severe at later disease stages, and is cell-type specific: It only appears in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, not in astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. 97 In addition, there are several gene mutations involved in the impairment of autophagy and lysosome function in both early-onset familial AD and late-onset AD, such as presenilin 1 ( PSEN1 ), presenilin 2 ( PSEN2 ), and phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein ( PICALM ) (summarized in Zhang et al. 98 ). Tau pathology is also closely related to this impairment of ALP in AD. Pathological tau causes dysfunction of autophagy and lysosomes, 98,99 while dysfunction of ALP results in the formation of tau oligomers and insoluble aggregates, 100 which exacerbates disease progression.\n\nAutophagy cargo receptors are involved in tau pathology in AD (Table 2). For example, p62/SQSTM1 has been found to colocalize with NFTs in the parietal cortex of AD patients (Braak stages V and VI) 101 andwithp-tauandamyloid β -peptide (A β ) in the temporal cortex of human AD brain. 102 In the middle and late stages of AD individuals (Braak stages IV and VI), the expression of p62 was decreased in the frontal cortex relative to age-matched controls and correlated with increased oxidative damage to p62 DNA promoter. 103 In the temporal cortex, increased p62 protein levels are found in AD compared to controls. 102,104,105 In AD brains, OPTN-positive neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions appear in areas severely affected by AD-type tau pathology. However, double immunofluorescence labeling did not show colocalization of the rare OPTN inclusions with the more frequent tau inclusions. 106 In post mortem hippocampal tissues, the accumulation of OPTN in histone deacetylase 6-positive aggresomes progressively increases from AD Braak stages III/IV to Braak stage VI. 107 Co-immunoprecipitation studies show that NDP52 associates with p-tau (Ser262/Ser356 [12E8] or a Ser396/Ser404 [PHF1]) from AD cerebral cortical samples, and the amount of ptau in sarkosyl-insoluble fractions is inversely proportional to that of NDP52. 82 The NBR1 protein and mRNA expressions are not altered in total brain homogenates from AD human patients compared to healthy controls. 108 However, NBR1 protein levels are significantly reduced in neurons and microglia, particularly in regions with intense A β deposition, but increased in astrocytes in the hippocampus of AD brains (Braak stages III and IV). 108 Therefore, in human AD brains, the dysregulation of autophagy cargo receptors may differ between brain regions and even between different cell types in the same area. Still, further comprehensive studies are needed to provide a clear understanding of ADpathology related to autophagy.",

The initial observation of their connection was the compensatory balance between the activities of UPS and ALP. 110 For instance, inhibition of the UPS by proteasome inhibitors results in compensatory activation of the ALP in cultured primary neurons, with a subsequent increase in tau degradation. 111,112 Underlying their crosstalk for tau\n\ndegradation, ubiquitin plays an important role in the molecular mechanism: Both systems target ubiquitinated tau and share a common ubiquitin receptor for delivery.\n\nUbiquitinated tau can be degraded by either the 26S proteasome or aggrephagy, an important selective variant of macroautophagy, depending on which type of ubiquitin chain linkage occurs. The ubiquitin sequence contains seven lysine residues (at positions 6, 11, 27, 29, 33, 48, and 63), and polyubiquitin chain assembly can occur by covalent bonds between the C-terminus of one ubiquitin and any one of the seven lysine residues or the N-terminus of the adjacent ubiquitin. 113 ThepredominantpolyubiquitinconjugationisK48-linkedchains,which target proteins to the proteasome for degradation. 114 Another common polyubiquitin conjugation is K63-linked chains, which regulate proteasome-independent pathways, such as ALP. 115 In addition to polyubiquitination, monoubiquitination, conjugation of a single ubiquitin molecule to the substrate's protein amino group or multiple amino groups, is another important signal for proteasomal degradation. 116 Tan et al. showed that K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitination, as well as monoubiquitin modification, contributed to the biogenesis of tau inclusions, but only K63 ubiquitin-modified tau inclusions were preferentially cleared by autophagy. 117 K63-linked ubiquitination is also associated with enhanced seeding activity and propagation of pathological tau. 118 TheE3ligase CHIP can ubiquitinate tau by forming K48and K63-linked ubiquitin chains. 27 The ability of CHIP to form different ubiquitin linkages depends on its E2 partners: CHIP forms specific K63-linked chains using Ubc13-Uev1a as its E2, but when CHIP is paired with E2 UbcH5a, it forms either K63- or K48-linked chains. 119 Tau is also a K63-polyubiquitinated substrate of TRAF6, another E3 ligase targeting tau. 35 Interestingly, a recent study revealed that E3 ligase TRIAD3A catalyzes mixed K11/K63 polyubiquitin chains and self-assembles into liquid-liquid phase separated droplets. 51 Tau is ubiquitinated and converted into fibrillar aggregates within TRIAD3A droplets, which interact with LC3 to deliver the complex to autophagosomes for autophagic degradation. Regarding tau monoubiquitylation, E3 ligase axotrophin/MARCH7 monoubiquitinates tau at multiple sites including the microtubule-binding domain, 36 and E2 UBE2W monoubiquitinates the N-terminus of Tau K18 . 59 Therefore, under various circumstances, tau can be ubiquitinated by different enzymes, forming distinct ubiquitin linkages that encode the degradation pathway.\n\nThe most studied ubiquitin receptor is p62/SQSTM1, which is not only the shuttle factor for UPS but also the autophagy cargo receptor for ALP. p62/SQSTM1 can bind to ubiquitinated proteins via its C-terminal ubiquitin-associated domain, to the proteasome via its Nterminal Phox-BEM1 domain, and to autophagic membranes via its LC3-interacting region. 22 Studies show that the UPS/ALP choice is determined by the oligomeric state of ubiquitin receptors, rather than their ubiquitin-binding properties. 120 The p62/SQSTM1 dimers recognize ubiquitinated proteins and shuttle them to the proteasome for UPS degradation, whereas higher-order oligomers of p62/SQSTM1 take up ubiquitinated proteins in the form of p62/SQSTM1 bodies that subsequently recruit autophagic membranes for ALP (reviewed in Pohl and Dikic 121 ). Regarding tau degradation, Babu et al. 35 found that polyubiquitinated tau interacts with the ubiquitin-associated domain of p62/SQSTM1 and that tau fails to interact with the proteasome in brain lysates of p62/SQSTM1 knockout mice, indicating a requirement for p62/SQSTM1 shuttling of tau to the proteasome. Falcon et al. showed that p62/SQSTM1 targeted seeded tau aggregates for ALP degradation in cells overexpressing Tau P301S treated with DyLight-labeled aggregated Tau P301S. 122 In animal models, genetic inactivation of p62/SQSTM1 leads to the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau, 79,123 and overexpression of p62/SQSTM1 in tau transgenic mouse (rTg4510) brains ameliorates tau pathology. 80 In the brains of AD patients, p62/SQSTM1 is colocalized with pathological tau (Table 2). However, detailed molecular roles of p62/SQSTM1 in tau degradation by UPS or ALP are lacking. This needs to be investigated to reveal, for instance, which oligomeric state of p62/SQSTM1 is involved in which tau degradation pathway.",

        "title": "3 TARGETING DEGRADATION PATHWAYS FOR TAU CLEARANCE",
        "content": "There are multiple strategies to promote the clearance of pathological tau for AD treatment, such as proteasome activators and autophagy modulators. 12 However, proteasome activators have tumorigenesis potential and show unspecific effects on other proteolytic pathways, 124 and autophagy modulators exhibit low pharmacological specificity for their targets in the autophagy process. 125 A new strategy - targeted protein degradation - recently emerged as a modality in drug discovery where bifunctional molecules bring the target protein to the degradation machinery. In this way, targeted protein degraders can promote the degradation of tau, an 'undruggable' protein, with high specificity. 16 Moreover, targeted protein degraders are eventdriven with catalytic activity, requiring only a transient binding event for activity, which significantly lowers the effective concentrations and expands the therapeutic window. 126",

        "content": "Currently, most of the targeted protein degraders for tau are PROTACs (Table 3). PROTACs are bifunctional molecules that induce selective degradation of specific proteins by harnessing a cell's UPS.

(A) PROTACs bring the target protein close to the E3 ligase, which results in protein ubiquitination, followed by proteasomal degradation. (B) AUTOTACssimultaneously interact with the target protein and the autophagy cargo receptor (eg, p62/SQSTM1), which facilitates p62/SQSTM1 self-polymerization in complex with target proteins. Then the complex is delivered to the phagophore by binding to LC3, followed by autophagosome formation and lysosomal degradation. (C) RING-Bait contains a RING domain of the E3 ligase tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) and a bait, such as the target protein. During the target protein aggregation, RING-Baits are recruited into the aggregates. This clustering dimerizes the RING domain and activates its E3 function, leading to subsequent proteasomal degradation.

Tau clearance induced by C8 in the HEK293-hTau cell model is through the UPS but not the ALP, as shown by using proteasome inhibitor MG132 and autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1. 129 C8 showed good blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability in BALB/C nude mice by in vivo imaging after intravenous injection (3.0 mg/kg). Purified pAAV-hSyn-hTau-mCHERRY-3 × FLAG virus was injected bilaterally into the hippocampus CA1 region of male C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks old) to induce hTau-overexpressed mouse model. In this mouse model, C8 treatment (10 mg/kg, i.p., 3 times/week for 1 month) ameliorated cognitive dysfunction in novel object recognition and Morris water maze and reduced total tau and p-tau levels in the hippocampus. 129",

        "title": "3.1.2 PROTAC T3: Degradation of alpha-synuclein and tau",
        "content": "In several neurodegenerative illnesses, tau and alpha-synuclein ( α -Syn) play key roles in the manifestation of pathology. 146-148 Under pathological conditions, partially unfolded proteins like tau and α -Syn can form aberrant cellular aggregates and toxic oligomers. Genome-wide association studies of tau and α -Syn support their clinical relationship and the co-occurrence of their fibrillar aggregates in many illnesses. 149,150 In neurodegenerative diseases, multitarget treatment may hold significant promise for improving efficacy. Zhu et al. devised an innovative approach to targeting both tau and α -Syn: a dual PROTAC T3. 132 This PROTAC was developed by using 2-[49-(Methylamino)phenyl]-6-methylbenzothiazole (BTA) as tau and α -Syn target warhead and pomalidomide as E3 ligase cereblon (CRBN) binder. BTA, an analog of thioflavin-T, can be used as a warhead to degrade protein aggregates due to its high brain penetration and ability to bind to aggregates and oligomers. 130,131 Alabel-free fluorescence polarization assay demonstrated that BTA had a strong ability to bind to preformed fibrils from tau and α -Syn; the K D values were 2.55 ± 0.72 and 0.32 ± 0.17 µM, respectively. To increase the likelihood that the target protein would associate with the ubiquitin ligase complex, conformational flexible polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based chains were used. 151 The PEG4-derived linkers exhibited higher degradation efficiency compared to other types of linkers. A preformed tau fibrilseeding HEK293T cellular model and an α -Syn overexpression preformedfibril-seeding model in HEK293T cells were created to evaluate the degrading effects of T3. T3 induced a concentration-dependent decrease in total tau and p-tau levels following a 24-h treatment. T3 demonstrated the highest degradation rate ( D max ) of 61% and a half degradation concentration (DC 50 ) of 4.09 ± 0.90 µM against tau. Additionally, there was a notable decrease in the p-tau (S404) protein level. It is interesting to note that after 24 h of T3 therapy, p-tau was more effectively degraded than total tau. For α -Syn, T3 showed the greater degradation rate ( D max ) of 78% and the half degradation concentra-\n\nFIGURE 4 Chemical structures of small-molecule proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and autophagy-targeting chimeras (AUTOTACs) for tau degradation.

Following a 48-h T3 therapy, there was a substantial drop in the protein level of pα Syn (S129). T3 also reduced α -Syn aggregate-induced toxicity in the SH-SY5Y cell model stably overexpressing α -Syn treated with liposome-packaged preformed fibrils. Under mechanistic evaluation, T3 enhanced the interaction between ubiquitination and α -Syn in co-immunoprecipitation analysis, and T3-mediated clearance of tau and α -Syn was through UPS, proved by using proteasome inhibitor MG132 and NEDDylation inhibitor MLN4924. T3 showed good BBB permeability not only in a monolayer cell model but also in a mouse model, as visualized by fluorescence imaging and a pharmacokinetic study. In vivo effects of T3 were evaluated in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model. T3 treatment (8 mg/kg/day, i.v., 7 days) reduced total tau and p-tau (S404) in the midbrain and hippocampus and reduced α -Syn and pα Syn (S129) in the midbrain and substantia nigra pars compacta. Preliminary safety testing showed that T3 had no significant side effects up to 80 mg/kg/day for 2 days. Even though T3 efficiently reduces aggregation, the binding to other potential targets or cellular receptors at micromolar concentrations limits the application of this molecule in clinical studies. 132",

C004019 promoted tau ubiquitination by inducing the association between tau and E3 ligase VHL, and proteasome inhibitor MG132 abolished C004019-induced tau clearance in HEK293-hTau cells. In vivo study showed that C004019 crossed the BBB in C57BL/6 mice after subcutaneous administration. C004019 effectively reduced total tau and p-tau levels in hippocampus and cortex of the human tau (hTau) transgenic mice ( Mapt tm1(EGFP)Klt Tg(MAPT)8cPdav/J) and 3 × Tg-AD mice, leading to improved synaptic and cognitive functions. 135 One concern is that C004019 can induce a sustained total-tau reduction in the brain of WT mice (4 months\n\nold) by a single-dose subcutaneous injection (3 mg/kg). Its effects on physiological tau might induce toxicity by impairing the physiological functions of tau.",

        "content": "The positron emission tomography (PET) tracer 18 F -T807 exhibits a conformation-dependent binding of p-tau, demonstrating maximal efficacy in carriers of MAPT mutations that result in AD-like PHF pathophysiology. 152 The design of QC-01-175, utilizing a T807 PET tracer core scaffold and pomalidomide as an E3 ligase binder, marks a significant step forward in targeting tau in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). 62 In the biolayer interferometry assay, T807 and QC-01-175 displayed a significantly lower affinity for immobilized, soluble tau than the reported affinity of T807 for native aggregated tau filaments. 62 QC-01-175 was tested in two tauopathy neuronal cell models, one derived from a progressive supranuclear palsy patient carrier of the Tau-A152T risk variant and one derived from a behavioral-variant FTD patient carrier of the Tau P301L autosomal-dominant mutation. 62 Dermal fibroblasts were reprogrammed into patient-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which were subsequently converted into corticalenriched neural progenitor cells and differentiated into neuronal cells (Tau-A152T and Tau P301L neurons). QC-01-175 treatment showed an efficient concentration-dependent reduction of total tau and p-tau (S396) levels in A152T and P301L neurons, leading on average to more than 70% and 60% clearance, respectively. The PROTAC selectively targeted tau in FTD neurons (mutant variants A152T and P301L) with minimal impact on tau in healthy control neurons, suggesting the potential to develop therapies that specifically degrade diseaseassociated tau in FTD-affected neurons while sparing normal tau protein. Further investigations showed that QC-01-175-mediated tau degradation was dependent on E3 ligase CRBN and tau binding, NEDDylation (E3 ligase function, using MLN4924), and proteasome function (using irreversible proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib), but not autophagy (using autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1). They also proved the ternary complex formation between tau, degrader, and CRL4 CRBN , followed by increased tau ubiquitination upon QC-01175 treatment. Moreover, QC-01-175 rescued viability loss caused by A β 1-42 in A152T neurons and had minimal off-target activity as determined by mass spectrometry proteomics. A pharmacokinetic study proved that QC-01-175 entered the brain after administration in mice. 137\n\nFurther, this group established a structure-activity relationship for QC-01-175 and optimized the PROTAC for better efficiency. 63 The study indicated that CRBN-targeting PROTACs are more effective in promoting tau degradation in human neurons compared to PROTACs targeting the E3 ligase VHL. These CRBN-targeting PROTACs have a more pronounced effect on insoluble tau in FTD neurons. Even though they have low to modest cellular permeability, they can exhibit prolonged effects on tau reduction up to 8 days following compound washout. The application of such a highly potent PROTAC in iPSC models underscores the potential of this approach in precision medicine, where targeted therapies can be tailored to specific disease subtypes and patient populations.",

The degradation of tau by I3 was found to be time-dependent, with maximum activity observed at 36 h after treatment.

        "title": "3.1.6 Pharmacokinetic challenges and strategies for CNS-targeted small-molecule PROTACs",
        "content": "Small-molecule PROTACs have a molecular weight exceeding 700 Da, poor solubility, and low permeability, making them challenging to formulate for oral delivery and limiting their ability to penetrate the BBB, a crucial factor for central nervous system (CNS)-targeted therapies. 153 Optimizing the pharmacokinetic properties of PROTACs, particularly for CNS applications, presents distinct challenges due to their structural complexity and physicochemical characteristics. The size and molecular complexity of PROTACs frequently violate traditional drug development guidelines, such as Lipinski's so-called Rule of Five, that emphasize the importance of parameters like molecular weight, lipophilicity, and hydrogen bonding for oral bioavailability. Moreover, during optimization, small structural modifications can affect the oral bioavailability, indicating that properties such as solubility/permeability can be affected not only by lipophilicity but shape, flexibility/rigidity, and pKa. 154\n\nAchieving the optimal balance of lipophilicity in PROTACs is another major challenge. Adequate lipophilicity can facilitate membrane permeability and support BBB penetration, but excessive lipophilicity can lead to increased non-specific interactions, poor solubility, and off-target effects. Hence, tuning the lipophilic properties of PROTACs is essential to maintain a balance between efficacy and safety. The modular design of PROTACs - comprising a ligand for the protein of interest, a linker, and an E3 ligase binder - offers multiple avenues for optimization.\n\nCNS-targeted drugs specifically benefit from having fewer hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) and a low polar surface area (PSA), typically below90Å 2 , to effectively cross the BBB. 155 However,PROTACsoften\n\nhave high PSA values and multiple HBDs due to their bifunctional nature, necessitating design modifications to reduce these features while retaining sufficient activity to induce protein degradation.\n\nLinker design plays a pivotal role in the pharmacokinetic profile of PROTACs. Incorporating rigid, cyclic structures within the linker can constrain the conformational flexibility of the molecule, leading to enhanced metabolic stability and improved BBB permeability. Reducing the number of rotatable bonds in the linker can also decrease the entropic penalty during target binding, making the overall molecule more drug-like. In recent studies, PROTACs that demonstrated 'chameleonic' properties, where they adapted their conformation based on environmental factors, showed promise in achieving better passive permeability. 156 These chameleonic behaviors often involve reversible intramolecular hydrogen bonds that stabilize compact, non-polar conformations in non-aqueous environments, aiding in BBB penetration while maintaining biological activity in target-rich aqueous conditions.\n\nExperimentalandcomputationalapproachestooptimizingPROTAC pharmacokinetics face inherent challenges due to the unique properties of these molecules. Standard in vitro assays for assessing parameters like permeability and protein binding, originally designed for small molecules, often yield unreliable or inconsistent results with PROTACs. This discrepancy is attributed to their size, lipophilicity, and tendency to adhere to labware or biological membranes, which can distort assay outcomes.Consequently,thereisapressingneedforassayadaptations and new methodologies tailored to PROTAC evaluation. 157 Computational modeling of PROTAC dynamics is similarly complicated. The flexibility and size of PROTACs create a multitude of potential conformations, complicating the prediction of how these molecules form the ternary complexes required for effective target degradation. Advances in molecular dynamic simulations and NMR spectroscopy are providing critical insights into the conformational states of PROTACs, but the predictive accuracy for CNS-targeting remains limited.\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers are trying novel approaches, such as designing PROTACs with conformationally constrained linkers, which reduces flexibility while maintaining high affinity for the target and E3 ligase. Additionally, the development of high-throughput screening methods, including direct-to-biology approaches, enables rapid assessment of large libraries of PROTAC variants. These screening techniques allow researchers to bypass some of the synthetic bottlenecks and directly evaluate PROTAC efficacy in cell-based systems, accelerating the optimization process. Furthermore, property-based guidelines specific to CNS-targeted PROTACs are being established, with particular emphasis on minimizing HBDs, managing PSA, and ensuring that lipophilicity remains within a suitable range for both oral bioavailability and CNS penetration. 158",

It significantly reduced total tau levels at concentrations above 100 µM in N2a cells. 142 This tau-reducing effect is dependent on both the E1 enzyme and proteasome activity, which was confirmed by using E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme inhibitor PYR-41 and proteasome inhibitor MG-132, respectively. To characterize the ability of Peptide 2 to penetrate cells, a fluorescent version of the peptide was synthesized by labeling it with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein.

To enhance cell uptake of the designed construct an octa D-arginine stretch (rrrrrrrr) was joined at the C-terminal side of the construct. 145 Keap1dependent Peptide 1 showed strong binding ability to Keap1 or tau in\n\nthe isothermal titration calorimetry assay and promoted interactions between Keap1 and tau in SH-SY5Y cells in co-immunoprecipitation analysis.

Keap1-dependent Peptide 1 reduced total tau levels in different tau-overexpressed cell lines (SH-SY5Y, N2a, and PC-12), with no changes in Keap1 levels. The mechanistic studies revealed that the tau clearance was mediated through Keap1-dependent ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated pathways, confirmed by the application of Keap1 siRNA silencing and the proteasome inhibitor MG132. This study proved that Keap1 could also be a promising E3 ligase adaptor for the design of tau-targeting PROTACs. 145\n\nMost peptides have poor stability in vivo due to the presence of proteases and low membrane penetration ability.

Compared to Peptide 1 only, the nanocomplex showed increased clearance efficiency for total tau and p-tau (T205) in N2a cells and induced the association between tau and Keap1 successfully. In 3 × Tg-AD mice, the nanocomplex also demonstrated a superior clearance of total tau and p-tau (T205) in the hippocampal and cortical regions of the brain and a superior therapeutic efficacy on cognitive function in Morris water maze.

        "content": "In addition to PROTACs, a new class of bifunctional molecules known as AUTOTACs has emerged (Figures 3 and 4). AUTOTACs differ from PROTACs in that they target proteins for degradation via the ALP rather than the UPS. AUTOTACs are composed of a target-binding ligand, a linker, and an autophagy-targeting domain. They can promote interactions between target protein and autophagy cargo receptors, leading to the activation of autophagy and the subsequent degradation of the target protein in the lysosome.\n\nJi et al. developed several ligands binding to the ZZ domain of p62/SQSTM1, which is one of the important autophagy cargo receptors for selective autophagy. 162,163 Then they used these p62/SQSTM1-ZZ-binding ligands to synthesize AUTOTACs, linking to different target-binding ligands via a repeating PEG moiety. The oligomeric modulator anle138b ([3-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-5(3-bromophenyl)-1H-pyrazole]) 164 and the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutiryl acid (PBA) were selected as the two target-binding warheads for misfolded protein aggregates. PBA-1105, PBA-1106, PBA-1105b, and Anle138b-F105 are examples of their designed\n\nAUTOTACs. These AUTOTACs exhibited excellent degradative potency against aggregation-prone P301L mutant tau and its aggregates and Q97 mutant huntingtin in cell models. An in vivo study showed that PBA-1105 treatment (20 or 50 mg/kg, i.p., 3 times/week, 4 weeks) induced marked clearance of detergent-insoluble Tau P301L in the brain in a dosage-dependent manner, but with no effects on WT murine tau levels. The use of AUTOTACs for targeted protein degradation represents a novel therapeutic approach, particularly for diseases where proteasome function may be compromised or where autophagy plays a critical role in disease pathology.",

        "content": "RING-Bait technology, a selective degradation method for tau aggregates, has shown promise in treating AD. In this approach, the RING domain of the E3 ligase tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) is fused to the 'Bait,' tau 165 (Figure 3). When the RINGtau is recruited into tau aggregates, the clustering dimerizes the RING domain and activates its E3 function, leading to subsequent degradation of tau aggregates. 165,166 In HEK293 cell models, RING-tau (P301S, 0N4R) prevented seeded tau (induced by heparin) aggregation and removed existing aggregates, with no significant effects on soluble endogenous tau levels. RING-tau (WT, 0N3R) and RING-tau (WT, 0N4R) prevented seeded tau aggregation induced by AD and PSP post mortem brain extracts, respectively. Similar effects were also observed in primary neurons from transgenic mice (Tau P301S). Mechanism investigation showed that E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme inhibitor TAK-243, VCP inhibitor NMS-873, or proteasome inhibitor MG-132 was able to reverse the aggregate removal effects, indicating that RING-tau was dependent on the UPS to degrade tau aggregates. An in vivo study showed that RING-tau treatment (packaged in AAV 9P31, i.v.) significantly and selectively reduced the burden of tau aggregates and improved motor functions in Tg2541 (Tau P301S) mice. A similar kind of approach based on the TRIM21 RING domain was devised by Benn et al. 167 In this approach, the RING domain of TRIM21 is fused with anti-tau C-terminal nanobody F8-2 168 and delivered to cells. RING-nanobody degraders prevented or reversed tau aggregation in cell and animal models, with minimal impact on monomeric tau. Though this technology can selectively clear tau aggregates, introducing a sufficient amount of RING-Bait degraders into the human brain is challenging. Both approaches used AAV gene delivery vehicles in animal studies; however, host immune responses remain a principal barrier for successful AAV gene therapy in humans. 169 Combining strategies to overcome AAV immune responses or apply alternative delivery methods for administration will increase the potential of RING-Bait technology in clinical study.",

        "content": "In summary, tau degradation mechanisms are complicated, and many factors determine which route is taken, such as tau post-translational\n\nmodifications, aggregation, and mutations. In AD, both UPS and ALP are impaired, and their lower efficiency has detrimental effects on tau turnover, potentially enhancing tau accumulation and pathology. Moreover, pathological tau further impairs degradative pathways, forming a vicious circle for AD progression. Several key factors targeting tau degradation, such as E3 ligases, DUBs, and autophagy cargo receptors, havebeensummarized,andtheirdysfunctioninADvariesconsiderably depending on different brain regions and disease stages. The human genomeencodesover600E3ligases 170 and nearly 100 DUBs. 171 Only a few of them have been reported to relate to tau degradation. More investigations are needed to determine whether other important E3 ligases or DUBs mediate tau degradation, especially distributed only in the brain and neurons, which can provide novel specific therapeutic targets. Importantly, UPS and ALP are coordinated, and ubiquitin plays an important role in most of their communications. 121 A deep understanding of their crosstalk can provide more specific controls for tau turnover by enabling the choice of the optimal pathway for degradation.\n\nAn emerging strategy to increase tau clearance is to target protein degradation by promoting UPS or ALP functions. Currently, most of the targeted protein degraders for tau are PROTACs. Almost all of these tau-targeting PROTACs are designed to recruit E3 ligase VHL or CRBN, which are expressed in the whole body and attach K48-linked ubiquitin chains to the target protein for proteasome degradation. 172 Choosing other E3 ligases with brain-, neuron-, or disease-specific expression profiles will significantly improve the specificity of PROTACs. Designing PROTACs to recruit E3 ligases able to form specific ubiquitin chains for aggrephagy could promote tau degradation via ALP, which is especially important for the clearance of tau-insoluble aggregates. Until now, only one publication reported the development of tau-targeting AUTOTACs, bringing tau close to p62/SQSTM1 to promote ALP degradation. 162 Other autophagy cargo receptors can also be applied for the design of tau-targeting AUTOTACs. In addition, many other strategies, such as autophagy-targeting chimera, autophagosometethering compounds, and lysosome-targeting chimera, can be applied to tau degradation via lysosomes. 173 The recent development of dephosphorylation-targeting chimaera provides an alternative strategy to promote tau degradation by recruiting phosphatases to tau for reducing tau hyperphosphorylation. 174-176 In most small-moleculetargeted tau degraders, the structures of tau-binding ligands are from tau PET tracers, tau aggregation inhibitors, and fluorescence probes for tau aggregates. Investigation into new ligands that selectively bind to more toxic forms of tau, such as hyperphosphorylated tau and tau oligomers, 177,178 might provide more efficient targeted protein degraders to cure tau pathologies. With more advanced biomarkers to help with staging AD, 179 it is crucial to apply these targeted tau degraders at the early stage, since both degradation pathways are impaired during disease progress.\n\nWith encouragement from PROTAC ARV-471, which degrades the estrogen receptor in breast tumors, in the clinical phase III stage, 180 we believe that targeted tau degraders will offer new treatment options for patients with AD or other diseases with tau pathologies.",

        "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common  case of dementia,  accounting  for  50-70%  of  cases,  is  a  progressive neurodegenerative  disease  characterized  by  decline  of  cognition and memory. The number of people living with dementia worldwide  was  estimated  to  be  55  million  in  2019,  and  the numbers  are  expected  to  reach  139  million  in  2050,  with two-thirds of those affected living in low- and middle-income countries.  The  economic  costs  associated  with  dementia  are formidable  and  are  estimated  to  more  than  double  from  1.3 trillion dollars per year in 2019 to 2.8 trillion dollars in 2030. 1) Amyloidβ (A β )  plaques  and  neurofibrillary  tangles  (NFTs) containing  phosphorylated  tau  protein  are  the  hallmarks  of AD.  Research  on  longitudinal  biomarkers  has  shown  that A β accumulation  starts  decades  before  the  onset  of  clinical symptoms followed by the spread of NFTs, which then causes neuronal  and  synaptic  loss  leading  to  cognitive  impairment. 2) Numerous  accounts  of  preclinical  and  clinical  evidence  suggest that the A β cascade and the hyperphosphorylation of tau play  major  roles  in  AD  pathogenesis. 3) Therefore,  targeting A β or  tau  have  been  the  primary  focuses  for  several  decades via multiple  approaches. 4,5) In  A β -targeted  approaches,  substantial  breakthroughs  have  been  made  with  A β antibodies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIndeed,  aducanumab was approved under conditional accelerated pathway by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S.  as  the  first  disease-modifying  agent  for  treating  AD, 6) and  lecanemab  have  been  granted  traditional  full  approval  in the  U.S.  and  Japan. 7,8) In  addition,  donanemab  was  reported to  meet  the  primary  endpoint  in  a  phase  3  study,  providing clinical benefits for some clinical scales and biomarkers, such as A β plaques and tau, which should accelerate the path to its approval. 9) Regarding  tau,  although  clinical  studies  of  many candidates  had  to  be  discontinued  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  or toxicity,  recent  progress  in  tau-targeting  therapies  is  evident but  without  successful  translation  into  clinical  benefits.

        "content": "2.1. The Amyloid Oligomer Hypothesis In 1992, based on  the  finding  of  a  pathogenic  mutation  in  the  A β precursor protein (APP) gene from familial Alzheimer's disease patients, Hardy  and  Higgins  formulated  the  amyloid  hypothesis  that brain A β plaque deposition could be the main pathogenic factor  of  AD. 10) The  A β formation  begins  with  APP  cleavage  by β -site  amyloid  precursor  protein  cleaving  enzyme  1  (BACE1)\n\n©  2024  Author(s)  This  is  an  open  access  article  distributed  under  the  terms  of  Creative  Commons  Attribution  4.0  License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/). Published by The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan\n\nto  generate  a  soluble  extracellular  fragment  (sAPP β )  and  a cell-membrane-bound  fragment  (C99).  Next,  C99  is  cleaved intracellularly  by γ -secretase,  yielding  an  amyloid  intracellular  domain  and  A β peptides  of  variable  lengths 11) (Fig.  1).  Of these A β peptides,  A β 42 having 42 amino acids is thought to be crucial for AD pathology, as it is more toxic and aggregates more easily than other forms. A β monomers aggregate to form various  species,  such  as  oligomers,  consisting  of  soluble  low molecular weight oligomers, protofibrils, and insoluble fibrils, ultimately forming A β plaques  (Fig.  2).  Although  A β plaques were  believed  to  be  the  pathogenic  form  of  A β ,  a  growing amount  of  pharmacological  evidence  suggests  that  A β oligomers,  especially  soluble  low  molecular  weight  oligomers  and protofibrils,  are  the  most  likely  pathogenic  form  of  AD. 12) In particular,  severity  of  cognitive  dysfunction  in  AD  patients was found to correlate better with the level of soluble A β species  than  insoluble  A β species  in  the  brains. 13,14) In  addition, the  selective  toxicity  of  A β oligomers  observed  in  cellular assays  further  supported  the  oligomer  hypothesis.  Several mechanisms, such as direct neurotoxicity via ion channel pore formation  or  receptor  binding  to  activate  signaling  pathways, are  considered  to  induce  neuronal  loss  and  cognitive  decline by  A β oligomers. 15) Finally,  recent  advances  achieved  by  the three  monoclonal  antibodies  of  aducanumab,  lecanemab  and donanemab  offer  support  for  the  amyloid  cascade  being  a pathogenesis  pathway  to  AD.  We  provide  updates  on  the  research and development of these three antibodies.\n\n2.2. Aducanumab Aducanumab  was  originally  discovered\n\nFig.  1. The Process of A β Formation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nby  scientists  at  Neurimmune  and  then  licensed  to  Biogen  and Eisai  for  clinical  development.  It  is  a  recombinant  human  antibody  derived  from  a  blood  lymphocyte  library  collected  from healthy elderly donors without signs of cognitive impairment. Importantly, the immune system of the donors successfully resisted AD,  and  therefore  the  antibody  from  their  blood  samples  could serve  as  potential  therapeutics  through  a  reverse  translational medical  approach. 16) Binding  kinetics  and  affinity  measurement studies confirmed that aducanumab selectively targeted A β oligomers. 17)\n\nTwo  phase  3  studies  (EMERGE  and  ENGAGE)  of  aducanumab  showed  discrepancy regarding efficacy of  slow -ing  cognitive  decline. 18) While  EMERGE  met  the  primary endpoint of the Clinical  Dementia  Rating-Sum  of  Boxes (CDR-SB), where the highest  dose  (10 mg/kg,  every  4  weeks) of  aducanumab  led  to  significant  reduction  in  the  CDR-SB score by about 20% in patients with early AD (mild cognitive impairment  (MCI)  due  to  AD  and  mild  AD  dementia)  at  78 weeks,  ENGAGE  did  not  meet  the  primary  endpoint.  However,  aducanumab  consistently  showed  significant  A β plaque clearance in the brain (amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET):  about  70%  decrease  in  EMERGE  and  about  59%  decrease  in  ENGAGE)  and  phosphorylated  tau  reduction  in  the plasma (surrogate biomarker of NFTs in the brain: about 13% decrease  in  EMERGE  and  about  16%  decrease  in  ENGAGE) in the both studies. These finding suggested that both A β and tau  could  influence  each  other,  and  A β immunotherapy could improve tau pathology. The most common adverse effect was amyloid  related  imaging  abnormalities  (ARIA;  ARIA-E:  suggestive  of  vasogenic  edema  and  sulcal  effusions;  ARIA-H: suggestive  of  hemosiderin  deposits).  These  occurred  in  about 35% of the treated patients in both studies at the highest dose.\n\nRegulatory authorities in the U.S., EU and Japan responded differently  to  aducanumab.  The  FDA  approved  aducanumab under the agency's accelerated approval pathway in 2021. 6) Although the results of the two phase 3 studies were inconsistent with respect to efficacy of slowing cognitive decline, the FDA has  determined  that  there  is  substantial  evidence  that  aducanumab consistently reduces A β plaques in the brain and that the  reduction  in  these  plaques  is  reasonably  likely  to  predict important  benefits  to  patients.  On  the  other  hand,  European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare  (MHLW) in Japan rejected marketing application for aducanumab. 19,20) These  authorities  have  concluded  that  the link between reduction of A β plaques in the brain and slowing cognitive decline had not been established in the two phase 3\n\nFig.  2. General Aggregation Scheme of A β from Monomers to Plaque\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstudies,  and  the  benefits  of  aducanumab  did  not  outweigh  the risk of ARIAs.\n\nLater,  Biogen announced that it would stop marketing aducanumab and terminate phase 4 study (ENVISION) to verify clinical  benefit  of  aducanumab,  due  to  realigning  resources for  AD franchise at Biogen. 21) The  rights  to  aducanumab will revert to the originator, Neurimmune.\n\n2.3. Lecanemab Lecanemab,  a  humanized  form  of  the mAb158 mouse antibody, was originally discovered at Uppsala University  and  is  being  developed  by  Eisai  and  Biogen.  This antibody  was  designed  to  preferentially  capture  A β protofi -brils. 22) The  rationale  came  from  the  pathology  of  Swedishtype inheritable AD (Arctic mutation), 23) where carriers of the Arctic mutation (E693G in APP) showed decreased A β monomer levels in plasma but enhanced formation of protofibrils in the  brain.  The  evidence  suggested  that  A β protofibrils  could be  a  primary  pathogenic  form  of  AD,  and  antibodies  targeting  protofibrils  might  have  superior  therapeutic  properties. In  a  large  phase  3  study  (Clarity  AD)  for  early  AD  patients, a  10  mg/kg  dose  of  lecanemab  every  2  weeks  reduced  A β plaques by about 60% based on the amyloid PET study and resulted in a significant reduction in the CDR-SB score by 27% at 18 months. Secondary endpoints also reflected the CDR-SB scores thus slowing cognitive decline or improving functional measures. ARIAs were observed in about 20% of the patients, which were higher frequency among apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε 4  carriers  and  patients  with  microhemorrhage  in  the  brains. The  occurrence  of  ARIAs  in  lecanemab  was  less  than  those observed  in  aducanumab. 8) Like  aducanumab,  phosphorylated tau related biomarkers were significantly reduced. 24) Based on these  promising  findings,  lecanemab  was  granted  traditional approval  by  the  FDA  as  a  treatment  for  AD  in  July  2023. 7) Also, lecanemab has been approved by the MHLW in Japan as a treatment for slowing progression of MCI and mild dementia due to AD. 8)\n\na  significant  reduction  of  A β plaques  in  the  brain  by  about 80%  based  on  amyloid  PET  imaging  and  reduced  the  CDRSB  score  by  35%  compared  with  the  placebo  at  18  months (700 mg  for  the  first  three  doses  and  1400 mg  thereafter  at every  4  weeks).  Also,  significant  reduction  in  phosphory -lated tau related biomarkers was observed. During the phase 3 study, treatment related ARIAs were frequent and observed in about 35% of the patients, 9) which was similar to or less than those  observed  in  aducanumab. 6) The  data  encouraged  the start  of  global  regulatory submissions, and Eli Lilly has completed  submission  for  full  approval  to  the  FDA  in  July  2023 and the MHLW in September 2023. 28,29)\n\n2.4. Donanemab Donanemab  is  a  humanized  antibody with  selective  affinity  to  N-terminally  truncated  and  pyroglu -tamate-modified  A β (A β pE3).  A  part  of  the  A β monomer  is subjected  to  N-  and/or  C-terminal  modification,  and  A β pE3 was  identified  in  sufficient  quantities  as  an  N-truncated  A β variant  in  A β plaques  derived  from  postmortem  AD  brains, indicating that A β pE3 could be a pathogenetic form of AD. 25) Thus,  donanemab  was  designed  to  remove  existing  A β burdens  in  the  brain.  A β pE3  peptides  are  also  known  to  form stable  and  soluble  oligomers  and  induced  neurodegeneration in  AD  mouse  models. 26) Eli  Lilly  announced  a  positive  find -ing  for  donanemab  in  a  phase  3  study, 27) where  it  showed\n\n2.5. Future Directions for A β Antibodies Solanezumab,  selectively  targeting  A β monomers,  failed  to  reduce A β plaques  and  slow  cognitive  decline  in  a  phase  3  study, 30) most  likely  because  monomers  might  not  be  the  right  target among  the  A β species.  Indeed,  A β monomers  were  reported to be physiologically important but not a pathological form of AD. 31) On the other hand, there were several clinically inves -tigated antibodies having high affinity for A β oligomers, other than  aducanumab and lecanemab; however, all of them failed to  show  clinical  benefits 4) (Table  1).  For  example,  bapineu -zumab  and  gantenerumab  can  bind  a  broad  range  of  the  A β species, 17,32) and crenezumab has preferential affinity for A β oligomers  as  well  as  A β monomers. 33) A  plausible  reason  for such  unsatisfactory  clinical  outcomes  could  be  a  competitive binding with A β monomers. Indeed, A β monomers exist abundantly  in  both  the  brain  and  its  periphery,  and  most  of  such antibodies  can  be  captured  by  these  monomers,  which  would lead to a significant decrease in efficacy levels over A β oligomers. 34) Taken together, high selectivity for A β oligomers with low affinity for monomers appear to be a crucial profile for an A β antibody to be useful for AD therapeutics. As noted above, soluble  oligomers  of  A β exhibited  selective  toxicity  in  cells and  could  be  involved  in  AD  pathogenesis,  which  is  also  the basis for suggesting that A β oligomers are one of the primary targets for A β antibodies.\n\nPeripheral  administration  is  not  conductive  to  delivering an  antibody  to  the  brain  at  a  sufficiently  high  dose  due  to low  blood-brain  barrier  (BBB)  penetration  (approx.  0.1%  of injected  dose  in  general). 35) Therefore,  antibodies  engineering  to  achieve  enhanced  BBB  crossing  have  been  attracting. Such  engineered  antibodies  are  expected  to  improve  clinical efficacy and reduce dosages, which could contribute to amelio -rating side effects, such as ARIAs. 36) One example to achieve high BBB penetration is Denali's Antibody Transport Vehicle (ATV) technology.  The  transferrin  receptor  is  responsible  for\n\nTable  1.

Therefore, an antibody with a transferrin receptor 1-binding  domain  can  bind  to  receptors  on  endothelial  cells,  which enables to penetrate the BBB through active receptor-mediated transport 37) (Fig. 3). Biogen announced the leveraging of ATV technology  to  develop  next  generation  A β antibodies  to  increase brain exposure along with reduced ARIAs. 38) Eisai also announced  that  they  are  investigating  the  application  of  their original  brain  transport  technology  to  develop  the  next-generation  lecanamab. 39) Likewise,  Roche  developed  the  Brainshuttle  technology  in  which  a  Fab  antibody  fragment  can  bind transferrin receptor 1. Indeed, their new antibody trontinemab, gantenerumab  with  the  Brainshuttle,  improved  BBB  crossing  and  cleared  A β plaques  with  fewer  ARIAs. 40) Detailed investigations  on  brain-penetrating  A β antibodies  using  such technologies  could  help  understand  the  mechanism  behind ARIAs  along  with  significant  reduction  in  dosage,  thus  pro -viding affordable treatment options for AD. If a low dose and brain-penetrating  A β antibody  can  be  confirmed  to  be  safe, long-acting injection formulation may be used to increase the convenience of patients and caregivers.\n\nThe  adverse  effects  of  ARIAs  shown  above  and  issues  on the affordability of A β antibodies 41) encourage reconsideration of small molecule inhibitors for the two enzymes, BACE1 and γ -secretase  responsible  for  A β production (Fig. 1), as main -tenance  therapy  after  treatment  with  A β antibodies,  once  A β plaques or oligomers have been cleared. 42,43) All  clinical  trials on BACE1 inhibitors were discontinued due to the occurrence\n\nTfRl:Transferrinreceptor-1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFig.  3. Overview of Denali's Antibody Transport Vehicle\n\nof  adverse  events,  which  include  cognitive  impairment  likely derived  from  the  cleavage  of  other  substrates,  particularly SEZ6  that  is  involved  in  synaptic  plasticity. 44,45) However, BACE1 inhibitors having selectivity  over  BACE2  could  ameliorate  this  adverse  event. 46,47) Modulators  of γ -secretase  are also being reconsidered as they can curb the Notch-interfering ability  of γ -secretase  inhibitors.  Indeed,  scientists  at  Roche reported  on  RG6289,  which  inhibited  A β 40  and  A β 42  production  without  affecting  total  A β production  and  showed  a safe  profile  with  only  mild  adverse  events.  On  the  basis  of the  promising  profiles  observed  in  the  phase  1  study,  Roche plans  to  initiate  a  phase  2  study. 44) Clinical  trials  to  confirm the  potential  of  maintenance  therapy  with  BACE1  inhibitors and γ -secretase  modulators  should  be  considered  to  provide another option for patients and caregivers to address the issues of immunotherapy.",

        "content": "3.1. The  Tau  Hypothesis Tau  is  a  microtubule-associated  protein  encoded  by  the  microtubule-associated  protein tau  (MAPT) gene,  which  is  abundant  in  the  brain. 48,49) There are  six  tau  isoforms  in  the  adult  human  brain,  which  are  differentially  expressed  during  development. 50) Physiologically, tau plays a key role in maintaining the structure and stability of  neuronal  axons.  In  dendrites,  it  supports  the  spine  remodeling  necessary  for  synaptic  plasticity. 51) The  physiological functions  of  tau  are  modulated  by  the  proper  maintenance  of modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation. On the other  hand,  when  excessive  modifications  occur,  tau  loses  its ability  to  bind  to  microtubules,  undergoes  structural  changes, and  forms  aggregates  and  neurofibrillary  tangles  containing NFTs 52) (Fig.  4).  NFTs  are  a  major  pathological  hallmark  of AD, in which tau fibrillates and deposits in the cytoplasm, 52,53) resulting  in  microtubule  destabilization,  impairment  of  synaptic function and morphology, and neurodegeneration. 54) Importantly,  the  presence  of  tau  is  required  for  A β -induced neurotoxicity  and  cognitive  dysfunction. 55,56) Likewise,  associations between the onset of AD symptoms and the development of NFTs were found in clinical situations.  For  example, asymptomatic  subjects  with  A β accumulation  (amyloid  PET positive)  but  not  NFTs  (tau  PET  negative)  did  not  show  cog -nitive  decline  over  at  least  3  to  5  years,  while  asymptomatic subjects who were both amyloid and tau PET positive showed continuously cognitive worsening. 57) More importantly, tau aggregation  correlates  well  with  cognitive  deficit, 58) suggesting\n\nFig.  4.

In  this  review,  we  provide  updates  on small  molecules  such  as  tau  modification  and  aggregation  in -hibitors, immunotherapies, and antisense oligonucleotides that have advanced into clinical development.\n\n- 3.2. Tau  Modification  Inhibitors In AD,  the physiological  function  of  tau  is  thought  to  be  lost  when  it  undergoes  excessive  post-translational  modifications. 50) Therefore, several modification inhibitors have been developed. For example,  small  molecules  targeting  glycogen  synthase  kinase 3 β (GSK3 β )  have  been  well  investigated.  GSK3 β is  involved in tau hyperphosphorylation and promoting tau aggregation. 60) One  GSK3 β inhibitor,  tideglusib,  was  found  to  be  safe  and prevented  brain  volume  loss  in  a  phase  2  trial  but  did  not meet  the  primary  endpoint  for  cognitive  function. 61) Several companies have pursued GSK3 β inhibitors,  but  no  compound is currently in clinical development. 62) O-GlcNAcase is the en -zyme responsible for the hydrolysis of the O-linked β -N -acetyl glucosamine  (O-GlcNAc),  and  O-GlcNAc  inhibitors  are  in clinical  trial  by  several  companies  to  intervene  in  the  posttranslational  modification  of  tau.  Because  O-GlcNAcylation and  phosphorylation  can  crosstalk via tau  protein, 63) the  predominance  of  tau  O-GlcNAcylation  by  O-GlcNAcase  inhibi -tors is considered to prevent hyperphosphorylation. 64) At present, LY3372689 is the only compound in phase 2 trials, where safety, tolerability, and efficacy are being investigated. 65)\n- 3.3. Tau  Aggregation  Inhibitors When  tau  undergoes modifications  such  as  phosphorylation  and  acetylation,  it  is thought to form aggregates which leads to neurodegeneration. The  tau  protein  aggregation  inhibitor  TRx0237,  also  known as methylene blue, is currently in the clinic. 66) Methylene blue reduced  aggregates  and  ameliorated  deficits  in  a  variety  of behavioral  phenotypes  in  two  tau  preclinical  models. 67) More recently,  a  compound  preventing  the  early  stages  of  tau  aggregation was discovered, and a phase 1 trial is underway. 68,69)\n- 3.4. Immunotherapies Tau aggregates in cells are considered  to  cause  neurodegeneration,  and  some  tau  species\n\nare  known  to  spread  among  cells via different  cell  types  and pathways. 70) Immunotherapies  targeting  to  the  prevention  of tau  seeding  and  propagation  have  been  investigated.  Indeed, regarding  passive  immunization,  antibodies  against  various epitopes  have  been  advanced.  Unfortunately,  multiple  antibodies  targeting  the  N-terminal  epitope  have  failed  to  show clinical  benefit. 71-73) Recently,  the  microtubule  binding  region (MTBR)-tau has been found to correlate well with AD pathology  and  clinical  progression. 74) Antibodies  targeting  MTBRtau inhibited seed  aggregation  in  cellular assays  and  tau accumulation  in  mice  injected  with  brain  extracts  from  AD patients. 75,76) Increasing  evidence  on  MTBR-tau  provided  the opportunity  to  initiate  efforts  on  exploring  antibodies  target -ing  MTBR-tau.  A  major  advancement  has  been  the  development of E2814, a MTBR-tau antibody discovered as part of a collaboration  between  University  College  London  and  Eisai, E2814  showed  target  engagement  with  tau  in  the  CSF,  with no  significant  adverse  events  related  to  the  drug  being  ob -served. 77) E2814 was chosen to be evaluated in the Dominantly Inherited  Alzheimer  Network  Trials  Unit  (DIAN-TU),  investigating  both  single  and  combination  therapy  with  lecanemab for asymptomatic and symptomatic participants. 78) Other antibodies  targeting  MTBR  and  nearby  tau,  such  as  PRX005 or  bepranemab,  were  shown  to  be  safe  with  dose-dependent exposure  in  the  plasma  and  CSF,  and  phase  1  and  phase  2 studies are ongoing. On the other hand, clinical trials of many anti-tau  antibodies  missed  their  primary  endpoints,  gosuranemab, semorinemab, tilavonemab, and zagotenemab which can act  in  the  extracellular  region. 74) For  active  immunotherapy (tau vaccine), clinical studies of AADvac1 and ACI-35030 are ongoing, and of particular interest is AADvac1. 68,79) In a phase 2  study,  AADvac1,  designed  to  target  N-terminally  truncated tau, was found to be safe and well tolerated with a significant reduction  in  blood  neurofilament  light  chain  (NfL)  levels  and a  tendency  of  a  decline  in  levels  of  total  tau  and  p-tau  in  the CSF.  In  the  clinical  study,  the  whole  analysis  failed  to  show cognitive benefit, while a post  hoc analysis  predicted  positive results for patients with both A β and tau positive. 80)\n\n- 3.5. Antisense  Oligonucleotides Antisense  oligonucleotide  (ASO)  technology  targeting  human  MAPT  mRNA  to\n\ndecrease  the  expression  of  tau  also  has  therapeutic  potential. Two  ASOs  BIIB080  and  NIO752  were  tested  for  effects  on AD. 81,82) In  non-clinical  studies,  BIIB080  inhibited  tau  aggregation in cellular assays, reduced mRNA and protein levels in transgenic mice, and suppressed neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. 83) In a phase 1b study, BIIB080 reduced both CSF tau  and  tau  aggregation. 84) Also,  BIIB080  showed  favorable trends  on  cognitive  function,  where  the  CDR-SB  score  of participants in high-dose groups tended to be declined relative to  those  in  low-doses  and  placebo  groups. 85) Further  clinical studies  will  clarify  clinical  benefit  of  BIIB080  for  mild  cog -nitive  impairment  or  mild  dementia  due  to  AD.  Another  tau ASO  NIO752  is  in  phase  1  clinical  studies,  and  the  results have not been disclosed yet.\n\n3.6. Future  Directions  for  Anti-tau  Therapies Many clinical  trials  of  tau  aggregation  inhibitors  have  failed  to show  clinical  benefits,  although  O-GlcNAcase  inhibitors  are in  clinical  testing  to  examine  their  potential.  Targeting  tau aggregation  through  post-translational  modification  might  be inappropriate  as  it  is  difficult  to  selectively  capture  patho -logical forms of tau. A tau ASO has shown a positive trend on cognitive functions along with reduction in biomarkers related to tau, indicating a potential to be anti-tau therapeutics. Also, a  tau  vaccine,  AADvac1,  showed  functional  benefits  in  the clinic  and  is  awaiting  completion  of  a  phase  2  study  to  see whether it can meet the primary endpoint, which would assess the  potential  of  this  approach.  Although  anti-tau  antibodies have  experienced  many  failures,  some  antibodies,  such  as E2814, exhibited functional benefits reducing tau levels. Con -sidering  that  the  failed  antibodies  targeted  N-terminal  fragments, the MTBR region could be a relevant target for anti-tau antibodies.  Nevertheless,  thorough  investigation  on  the  selection  of  the  epitope  should  be  a  key  to  successfully  targeting pathological tau. Tau antibodies also face common challenges with A β antibodies, e.g. ,  crossing the BBB. Although drug-related adverse events are limited with tau antibodies, improved brain penetration is needed to enhance efficacy. Also, clinical studies  must  select  the  suitable  patient  populations  based  on clinical  stages  and  pathogenesis.  Finally,  combination  therapy of  tau  antibodies  with  A β antibodies  could  be  appropriate  as both A β and  tau  are  likely  to  be  involved  in  the  pathogenesis of AD.",

        "content": "Although  lecanemab,  and  donanemab  have  achieved  remarkable success in the clinical developments for treating AD, their  clinical  effects  for  symptomatic  patients  have  been  rela -tively  moderate. The growing consensus is that more efficient intervention  with  A β antibodies  and  anti-tau  drugs  should  be able to prevent or delay the onset of AD in asymptomatic individuals having A β and tau pathology, because accumulation of  A β plaques  precede  symptom  onset  by  10-20  years.  The National  Institute  on  Aging  and  the  Alzheimer's  Association (NIA-AA)  published  a  draft  of  revised  clinical  guidelines  to recommend  the  diagnosis  and  staging  of  AD  by  abnormalities  on  A β and  tau  biomarkers,  regardless  of  the  presence  or absence  of  cognitive  impairment. 86) Most  of  the  therapeutics have  been  investigated  with  symptomatic  patients  so  far,  and more  clinical  investigations  are  needed  on  A β antibodies  or anti-tau  drugs  for  asymptomatic  (preclinical  AD)  patients. Considering  the  timing  of  accumulation  of  A β and  tau,  it should  lead  to  more  feasible  clinical  trials  in  terms  of  cost, duration,  and  the  number  of  patients.  Indeed,  lecanemab  and donanemab have been in clinical trials for preclinical AD, 87,88) and E2814, a MTBR-tau antibody, will be also investigated for preclinical AD. 89)\n\nAs discussed above, selective  targeting  of  A β oligomers  or fibrillar A β plaques, which are the plausible pathogenic forms, and avoiding binding to A β monomers could be keys to functional  and  cognitive  benefits.  Understanding  the  mechanism behind  ARIAs  is  required  to  increase  the  clinical  benefit  of A β antibodies. Regarding tau-targeting therapies, anti-tau antibodies  look  promising  as  they  offer  functional  benefits in  clinical  use.  Like  A β antibodies,  the  choice  of  the  epitope is  important  to  reduce  pathological  tau  leading  to  significant efficacy.  Targeting  the  MTBR  region  could  be  ideal  consider -ing the functional efficacy observed with E2814. The ongoing clinical trials for tau ASOs and tau vaccines should determine their potential. A common challenge for A β and tau antibodies is  crossing  the  BBB  to  increase  both  efficacy  and  safety.  One promising  approach  to  deliver  antibodies  to  the  whole  brain is  a  technology  leveraging  receptor  mediated  active  transport.  Also,  maintenance  therapy  using  BACE1  inhibitors  or γ -secretase  modulators  after  immunotherapy  offers  another treatment  option  to  address  the  issues  of  ARIAs  and  the  affordability of antibodies. Finally, combination of A β antibody with  anti-tau  therapeutics  could  deliver  synergetic  clinical benefits.  Aducanumab,  lecanemab,  and  donanemab  reduced tau or neurofibrillary tangles along with A β plaque reduction, suggesting  the  interplay  between  the  A β and  tau  pathways thus  pointing  to  the  relevance  of  combination  therapy.  The finding  of  the  DIAN-TU  study  to  investigate  combination effects between E2814 and lecanemab are eagerly awaited.\n\nAcknowledgments The authors thank Dr. Takuya Oguma, Dr. Yuto Unoh and Mr. Takaya Izumi for providing invaluable feedback on this manuscript.\n\nConflict of Interest N.

In this study, potential molecular targets of quercetin were first identified using the Swiss Target Prediction platform and pathogenic targets of T͸DM and AD were identified using online Mendelian inheritance in man ȋOMIMȌ, DisGeNET, TTD, DrugBank, and GeneCards databases. The 9ͻ targets shared among quercetin, T͸DM, and AD were used to establish a protein-protein interaction ȋPPIȌ network, top ͸ͻ core genes, and protein functional modules using MCODE.

A protein functional module with best score was obtained from the PPI network using CytoHubba, and ͼ high-probability quercetin targets ȋAKTͷ, JUN, MAPK, TNF, VEGFA, and EGFRȌ were confirmed by docking simulations.

KEGG pathway enrichment analysis suggested that the major shared mechanisms for T͸DM and AD include 'AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications,' 'pathways in cancer,' and 'MAPK signaling pathway' ȋthe key pathwayȌ. We speculate that quercetin may have therapeutic applications in T͸DM and AD by targeting MAPK signaling, providing a theoretical foundation for future clinical research.\n\nAccording to the 2017 global burden of disease study, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the sixth and tenth leading causes of premature death   worldwide 1 , and many studies have found strong epidemiological, pathological, and clinical associations between T2DM and   AD 2 . The incidence of AD is about twofold greater in T2DM patients than in non-diabetic individuals, while a disproportionate number of AD patients have a history of early or clinical diabetes. Diabetes and AD also share numerous common risk factors, including metabolic disease (obesity), cardiovascular disease, older age, and progressive insulin   resistance 2 , as well as common pathogenic processes such as chronic hyperglycemia, tissue amyloid β (Aβ) deposition and toxicity, cellular oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation.\n\nIndeed, the term 'type 3 diabetes' has been proposed to describe AD based on the hypothesis that ADassociated dementia is caused in part by insulin resistance and insufficient insulin-like growth factor signaling in the   brain 3 . It is believed that endocrine and metabolic diseases characterized by elevated blood glucose due to insulin resistance and death of insulin-producing pancreatic islet β-cells can lead to chronic cardiovascular diseases and ultimately to AD. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of Aβ in the brain parenchyma (termed senile plaques, SPs) and abnormal hyperphosphorylation of the intermediate filament protein tau within neurons, forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). The presence of these inclusions results in synaptic loss, particularly in neocortex and hippocampus, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, ultimately leading to neuronal dysfunction and   death 4 . Tau protein and human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) deposits are also found in the pancreatic islets of T2DM patients. Moreover, pharmacological studies have shown that some traditional hypoglycemic drugs can slow the progression of   AD 4 .\n\nͷ Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan ͸ͻͶ͹ͻͻ, China. ͸ Department  of  Pharmacy,  Shandong  University  of  Chinese  Medicine,  Jinan  ͸ͻͶ͹ͻͻ,  China. ͹ Graduate Office, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan ͸ͻͶ͹ͻͻ, China.  ͺ Department of Rehabilitation Medicine,  Shandong  University  of  Traditional  Chinese  Medicine,  Jinan  ͸ͻͶ͹ͻͻ,  China. * email:  ͼͶͶͷ͸ͶͶ͸@ sdutcm.edu.cn ; ͶͼͶͶͶͶ͹ͷ@sdutcm.edu.cn\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=25,font=/WDEGSW+Corbel&gt;ol.:ȋͬͭͮͯ\n\nVol:.(1234567890)\n\nWhile there is strong evidence for an association between T2DM and AD at multiple levels, the seminal molecular mechanisms linking these disorders remain unknown. One potential strategy for identifying these molecular linkage pathways is to screen for common drug targets, which would also provide new possibilities for the treatment of T2DM and AD.\n\nQuercetin (3, 3 ′ , 4 ′ , 5, 7-pentahydroxyflavone) is a natural polyhydroxyflavonoid found in the flowers, leaves, and fruits of edible plants such as onion, apple, lettuce, and   cabbage 4 . In addition, many Chinese herbal medicines such as Sophora japonica, Ginkgo biloba leaves, Hypericum perforatum, and cortex moutan are enriched in   quercetin 5 . Numerous studies have documented bioactivities of quercetin relevant to T2DM and AD pathology, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, and hypolipidemic effects. Quercetin has also been shown to reduce blood glucose concentration and preserve islet function, insulin sensitivity, and β-cell numbers in diabetic model rats and   mice 6,7 .\n\nAt present, there is no broadly effective drug treatment to delay AD onset, slow progression, or improve outcome 8 , and the few approved mediations can only transiently improve   symptoms 9 . Also, many synthetic drugs with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, and (or) hypolipidemic activities induce adverse events that preclude clinical use. The use of natural substances to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and metabolic diseases such as T2DM is a promising alternative as such agents are often easily and inexpensively isolated and have well documented biomechanisms and safety profiles. Yao et al. conducted a cross-sectional study of nearly 20,000   people 10 . The results show that there is a significant negative correlation between dietary quercetin intake and the prevalence of T2DM in Chinese population, which suggests that dietary quercetin intake may play a positive role in the prevention and treatment of T2DM, such as anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory, blood sugar and blood lipid. At the same time, it is supported by   experiments 7 , Supplementation of quercetin can reduce the blood glucose concentration and promote islet in diabetic rats. β Cell recovery and increased insulin release. Quercetin has insulin sensitizing effect. Long term low-dose dietary supplementation can reduce insulin resistance (IR) 6 in diabetic mice. Quercetin and its glycosides have extensive neuroprotective effects against AD, and its mechanism mainly includes interference β-the formation and deposition of starch protein can inhibit the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein to intervene the disease development process of AD. It can play a protective role on nerve cells through anti-inflammatory response, antioxidant stress and inhibition of apoptosis. In addition, it also has estrogen like effect on nerve cells. In recent years, the estrogen like neuroprotective effect of quercetin has attracted more and more attention. Epidemiology found that the probability of ad in postmenopausal women is much higher than that in men, suggesting that estrogen reduction is a risk factor for AD, and estrogen replacement therapy may prevent and delay the occurrence of AD. Quercetin has also shown anti-dementia and neuroprotective efficacies in models of dementia/AD and ischemia-reperfusion injury by mitigating neuronal oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, and by improving calcium homeostasis, growth factor signaling, and neuroplasticity, ultimately preventing neuronal   apoptosis 11-15 . Further, a number of large double-blind clinical studies have demonstrated that quercetin can reduce the composite end-point of death in patients with T2DM and AD. In the present study, we used a systematic bioinformatics approach (network pharmacology) and molecular docking simulations to identify quercetin-binding targets that may also be potential therapeutic targets for AD and T2DM.",

The Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) was used to search for preparations with 'quercetin' as a key word, and results were then combined with the Chinese Medicine Encyclopedia database (ETCM) to find Chinese herbal medicines enriched in quercetin. Quercetin targets were then identified using the PubChem database with 'quercetin' as the key word. Based on the notion that drugs of similar structure will have common (overlapping) targets, five potential targets of quercetin were predicted using Swiss Target Prediction (http://  www.  swiss  targe  tpred  iction. ch/) 16 with species 'Homo sapiens' and a probability &gt; 0.1 as the selection criteria. Target names were standardized according to Uniprot protein database terminology (https://  www.  unipr  ot.  org/) 17 .\n\nScreening of quercetin targets for T͸DM and AD treatment. Pathogenic molecules contributing to T2DM and AD was screened using Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM, https://  omim.  org/) 18  TTD (http://  db.  idrbl  ab.  net/  ttd/),  DisGeNET  (https://  www.  disge  net.  org/),  DrugBank  (https://  www.  drugb  ank.  ca/) 19 , and  GeneCards  (https://  www.  genec  ards.  org/) 20 using  the  terms  'Type  2  diabetes  mellitus'  and  ' Alzheimer's Disease. ' By intersecting quercetin targets with disease-associated molecules targets using a Venn diagram, we obtained targets potentially relevant to T2DM and AD treatment. Cytoscape   software 21 was then used to map the component-target-disease network as described in detail below.\n\nConstruction  of  protein-protein  interaction  ȋPPIȌ  network. To  identify  interaction  targets  of quercetin potentially relevant to T2DM and AD pathology and treatment, we used the online drawing tool Interactive Venn (http://  www.  inter  activ  enn.  net/) 22 to construct a Venn diagram. The overlapping targets were then uploaded to the STRING11.0 platform (https://  string-  db.  org/) 23 to  obtain  a  protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The maximal clique centrality (MMC) algorithm in the CytoHubba plug-in was used for comprehensive analysis of network topology to obtain the top 25 hub   genes 23 .  Then   MCODE 24 ,  a  cluster analysis plug-in for Cytoscape3.6.0 (https://  cytos  cape.  org/), was utilized to further analyze the PPI network. The targets in the protein functional module with best MCODE score were selected as core targets for further molecular docking simulations.\n\nFigure 1.

Gene Ontology (GO) functional analysis  and  Kyoto  Encyclopedia  of  Genes  and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed using Metascape (https://  metas  cape.  org/) 25 , with p &lt;  0.01 as the cutoff criterion. The top 10 GO items and top 20 KEGG pathways that meet this criterion were visualized using OmicShare (http://  www.  omics  hare.  com/) and microscopic letter (http://  www.  bioin  forma tics.  com.  cn).\n\nConstruction of a component-target-pathway network. Cytoscape3.6.0 was used to construct a component-target-pathway network based on KEGG enrichment analysis, and the topological parameters of the network were analyzed using the built-in Network Analyzer tool.\n\nMolecular docking verification. The PDB formats of the core target proteins were downloaded from the RCSB PDB database (http://  www.  rcsb.  org/). We used PyMol 2.4 software to remove water molecules and separate the original ligand from the core target protein, and then imported the processed protein targets into AutoDock Tools 1.5.6   software 26 for  hydrogenation,  calculation  of  total  charge,  and  setting  the  atomic  type. Results were saved in 'pdbqt' format. The mol2 structures of the core targets were downloaded from the TCMSP database, and AutoDock Tools was used to set the rotatable bonds. Files were again saved in 'pdbqt' format and then imported to AutoDock Vina to perform molecular docking. Finally, PyMol software was used to visualize the docking results and establish the docking interaction pattern.\n\nMolecular dynamics simulation. Amber14 was used for molecular dynamics simulation. Amber-99sb force field was used for protein system, gaff force field was used for quercetin molecule, TIP3P water molecule model and periodic boundary were used. All systems were first optimized, temperature rise and equilibrium, and then 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation was carried out by sander. Take the trajectory of 10-50 ns and calculate the binding energy between quercetin and protein using mm/pbsa.py. Analyze the trajectory using the cpptraj module in ambertools.

        "content": "Candidate  quercetin  targets  for  T͸DM  and  AD  treatment. After  screening  the  literature  and online databases, we identified 263 candidate gene products potentially targeted by quercetin. Screening for T2DM pathogenic targets retrieved 30 genes from OMIM, 175 from TTD, one from DisGeNET (with relevance score &gt; 0.1), 266 from DrugBank, and 1108 from GeneCards (relevance score &gt; 1). For AD, we retrieved 9 gene products from OMIM, 143 from TTD, 218 from DisGeNET, 67 from DrugBank, and 2712 from GeneCards. After removing duplicates, 1294 T2DM-related and 2865 AD-related genes were included in subsequent analyses. To obtain quercetin targets with relevance to T2DM and AD pathology and treatment, we constructed a Venn diagram, and a total of 95 overlapping targets were obtained (Fig. 2).\n\nPPI  network  of  quercetin  targets  for T͸DM  and AD  treatment. To  estimate  the  contributions of these candidate common targets to disease and reveal the interactive effects, all 95 were imported into the STRING database with highest confidence set at 0.9 to obtain a PPI network. The PPI network results were saved in TSV text format and imported into Cytoscape3.6.0 for network topology analysis to identify the top 25 targets (arranged in descending order of relevance as a concentric circle in Fig. 3A). The PPI network (Fig. 3B) includes 273 edges among the 95 nodes (circles), where edge thickness represents the interaction strength. To further refine the list of quercetin targets relevant to T2DM and AD treatment, we conduct cluster analysis on the PPI network based on shared mechanisms using MCODE. This analysis yielded a function module of five key nodal proteins (Fig. 3C). It is generally believed that proteins in such functional modules are more closely related and may interact to perform specific biological functions. Therefore, these proteins may have important regulatory effects on T2DM and AD.\n\nPossible molecular targets of quercetin and associated regulatory signaling pathways relevant to T͸DM and AD treatment.

Similarly, the top 20 KEGG pathway items were selected based on p values (Fig. 5A) and arranged according to category (Fig. 5B).\n\nThe common targets were enriched in molecules with GO molecular function terms 'cytokine receptor binding,' 'serine hydrolase activity, ' 'oxidoreductase activity, ' 'protein kinase binding, ' and 'antioxidant activity, ' biological processes terms 'positive regulation of cell apoptosis' (GO:0097190, GO:0010942, GO:0008285), 'regulation of inflammatory response' (GO:0050727), 'regulation of reactive oxygen species metabolic process' (GO:0072593), 'cellular response to external stimulus' (GO:0071496), and 'regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase activity' (GO:0071900), and cellular components terms 'membrane raft,' 'external side of plasma membrane,' 'extracellular matrix, ' 'vesicle lumen, ' 'endoplasmic reticulum lumen, ' 'cell body, ' 'receptor, ' 'perinuclear region of cytoplasm, ' 'actin-based cell projection, ' and 'apical part of cell. ' According to KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, most of these common targets are involved in 'MAPK signaling pathway,' 'TNF signaling pathway,' ' AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications,' 'pathways in cancer,' 'proteoglycans in cancer, ' 'interleukin (IL)-17 signaling pathway, ' 'hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 signaling pathway, ' 'PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, ' 'EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, ' 'Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, ' 'NF-kappa B signaling pathway, ' 'cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, ' 'VEGF signaling pathway, ' and (or) ' Alzheimer's disease.' Thus, the common targets of quercetin, T2DM, and AD are strongly enriched in 'MAPK signaling pathway' components as indicated by four of the MCODE nodes (Fig. 3C) and two of the top 10 GO molecular function items. In addition, most of the biological processes items are associated with MAPK activity, such as 'kinase activity regulation, ' 'cell proliferation, ' and 'apoptosis, ' suggesting that the MAPK signaling pathway is the core quercetin target relevant to T2DM and AD treatment.\n\nComponent-target-pathway network construction. A component-target-pathway network was constructed based on KEGG pathway enrichment analysis using Cytoscape3.6.0 (Fig. 6) in which the importance of a given node is indicated by the number of connections to other nodes. The average degree of importance (average number of connection to a given node) was 8.64, and there were 11 targets with degrees higher than 8.64: MAPK1 (degree = 18), AKT1 (degree = 15), PIK3R1 (degree = 14), IL6 (degree = 13), PRKCB (degree = 12), TNF (degree = 12),  VEGFA  (degree = 11),  EGFR  (degree = 11),  CASP3  (degree = 10),  BCL2  (degree = 9),  and  IL1B\n\nFigure 4.

Since MAPK1, AKT1, and EGFR were also included in the best scoring protein functional module, we speculate that these may be the key targets of quercetin for T2DM and AD treatment.\n\nMolecular docking results analysis. Finally, the interactions with core proteins in the PPI, MCODE, and component-target-pathway networks were verified by molecular docking simulations. The most likely and stable molecular interactions are generally those with lower energy after binding. Six core molecules were tested in docking simulations (Table 1 and Fig. 7), and all showed good binding affinity with an average free energy change of - 6.47 kcal/mol. For the quercetin-MAPK1 docking model, the small molecule ligand dapagliflozin potentially fit into the interface pocket formed by interacting amino acid residues in the protein. As shown in Fig. 7, a hydrogen bond was formed between quercetin and VAL302, HIS297, HIS139, and LYS205 near the active site of MAPK1.\n\nVol.:(0123456789)\n\nVol:.(1234567890)\n\nFigure 6.

After molecular docking, three proteins with good binding were selected according to the docking results, and the sander module in amber was used for 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation to analyze the stability of the system. The binding energy data of quercetin molecule and target protein were obtained by mm/GBSA calculation. After 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation, the structures of MAPK1 and TNF proteins are relatively stable, and JUN protein has certain structural changes. It is speculated that it is mainly due to the combination of JUN and DNA double strand in the original crystal structure to form a complex. This simulation only studies the combination of JUN and quercetin molecules, and deletes the DNA double strand, resulting in certain structural changes in the region where JUN binds to DNA.\n\nOn the whole, the binding of quercetin to the three proteins was relatively stable, and remained at the predicted binding site of molecular docking in the process of molecular dynamics simulation. Only certain conformational changes were observed in TNF system. The binding energies of quercetin molecule and three target proteins were further calculated by mm/GBSA method. The results showed that the binding energy between quercetin and TNF was the strongest, in fact MAPK1, followed by JUN. below is the binding energy (Table 2) and molecular dynamics simulation diagram (Fig. 8).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nQuercetin-TNF\n\nFigure 7.

Therefore, enhancing insulin sensitivity and reducing β-cell apoptosis are the ultimate strategies for the prevention and treatment of   T2DM 31 . Several studies have found that quercetin can reduce blood glucose, peripheral insulin resistance, and indicators of oxidative stress induced by high glucose in rats, a response profile similar to the widely used antidiabetic drug metformin.\n\nAlzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Clinically, it is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment, memory loss, and marked changes in personality and behavior. The two primary hypotheses proposed to explain the progressive neurodegeneration and neurological impairments of AD are cytotoxic β-amyloid deposition (plaque formation) due to abnormal processing and hyperphosphorylation of tau as these are the pathological hallmarks of the AD brain. In turn, these plaques and NFTs may cause oxidative stress and inflammation, leading to synaptic failure, neuronal apoptosis (especially basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and various hippocampal and cortical neurons), and brain   atrophy 32,33 . These pathomechanisms are not mutually exclusive and indeed may interact, creating pathogenic cascades. Thus, many protein signaling pathways and gene regulation pathways may contribute to the pathological changes in AD.\n\nMany natural components found in traditional herbal preparations have documented antioxidant, antiinflammatory, antidiabetic, and anti-apoptotic activities, suggesting potential utility for AD and T2DM treatment. For instance, quercetin can improve insulin production by rat insulinoma INS-1 cells in response to high glucose, as well as downregulate the relative expression levels of pro-apoptotic Bax and PDX-1 mRNAs, inhibit oxidative stress caused by   H 2 O2, and reduce INS-1 cell   apoptosis 34 . Quercetin can also clear reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species and inhibit the level of low density lipoprotein peroxidase, thereby reducing the incidence of cardiovascular   disease 35 . Further, quercetin was shown to reduce ischemic injury and peroxynitrate injury by inhibiting nitric oxide synthase and xanthine dehydrogenase   activities 36 .\n\nThe current study revealed several potential molecular mechanisms for AD and T2DM as well as possible treatment targets by combining network pharmacology with molecular docking. By integrating and collating information from several databases, we identified 95 potential quercetin targets involved in T2DM and AD pathology, and further defined a potential protein functional module of five proteins and 25 core genes from the PPI network. The biological processes mediated by these functional module proteins include protein kinase signaling and cell proliferation, consistent with pathogenic pathways of T2DM and AD identified in previous studies.\n\nCytoHubba and MCODE identified AKT1, JUN, MAPK, TNF, VEGFA, and EGFR as core targets of quercetin that may contribute to AD and T2DM. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is anti-apoptotic, and AKT1 inhibits Akt phosphorylation (activation), which in turn upregulates the activity of GSK3β, a kinase implicated in the pathogenesis of both T2DM and AD. JUN is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family implicated in the onset, progression, and reversal of vascular diseases through modulation of vascular cell protein expression, proliferation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Downregulation of JUN can significantly reduce the expression of inflammatory factors and inhibit endothelial cell   apoptosis 37 . Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a multifunctional cytokine that can directly damage islet β-cells and induce insulin resistance by inhibiting the transduction of insulin signals. MAPK is a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and inflammatory   responses 38 . Activation of MAPK can also increase tau phosphorylation in   neurons 39 , while inhibition of MAPK expression in hippocampus can significantly improve memory, cognitive function, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal   metabolism 40 . Suppression of MAPK can also improve insulin resistance by upregulating the expression of the insulin-dependent glucose transporter GLUT-4 in striatal muscle and adipose tissue, and by enhancing the sensitivity of insulin receptors, thereby promoting the absorption and utilization of glucose. Therefore, MAPK may be a core target for the treatment of T2DM and   AD 41 .\n\nFigure 9. Components of MAPK signaling pathway influenced by quercetin.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo better understand the interactions among these target genes, we conducted GO and KEGG pathway analyses. The target genes were mainly related to cell apoptosis, regulation of inflammatory response, regulation of ROS, metallic process, and other biological processes. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that target proteins are involved in the MAPK, TNF, HIF-1, IL-17, PI3K, NF-kappa B, Toll-like receptor, and VEGF signaling pathways, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, pathways in cancer, proteoglycans in cancer, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesize that quercetin may play a therapeutic role in T2DM and AD through the regulation of these pathways, but especially through modulation of MAPK signaling (Fig. 9).\n\nA variety of extracellular signaling molecules (growth factors, neurotransmitters, cytokines, hormones, etc.) stimulate MAPK signaling via the MAPKKK-MAPKK cascade, ultimately regulating both cytoplasmic processes and gene expression pathways underlying cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and stress responses. Three parallel MAPK signaling pathways are found in mammalian cells, extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). Inhibiting MAPK signaling can reduce oxidative stress and ensure the normal proliferation, differentiation, and insulin secretion capacity of islet   cells 42 . Further, inhibition of the MAPK pathway can improve learning and   memory 43 and suppress apoptosis of hippocampal CA1 neurons by downregulating the transcription factor c-Fos. Activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway may be an important mechanism underlying early and medium-term cognitive impairment in rats, while inhibition can reduce damage and promote the repair of damaged neurons. Quercetin acts on membrane EGFRs and TNFR1 by promoting the release of VEGFA and TNF, thereby affecting the activation of Ras, Raf, MEK, and phosphorylation of MAPK1 and MAPK3, leading to changes in angiogenesis, cell apoptosis, and cell proliferation. More in-depth studies on these mechanisms and preclinical studies in T2DM and AD animal models are warranted to provide a foundation for future clinical studies targeting the MAPK signaling pathway as a novel therapeutic strategy for T2DM and AD.\n\nIn conclusion, we have identified several potential molecular mechanisms by which quercetin can simultaneously interfere with T2DM and AD progression. Among these, suppression of MAPK signaling appears to be the most promoting strategy for the treatment of T2DM and AD.",

Moreover, abnormalities in lipid metabolism have been  identified  as  the  third  pathological  feature  of  AD, associated  with  disease  onset  and  progression  [5].  Lipids, constituting 50% of the brain's weight, encompassing fatty  acids,  cholesterol,  phospholipids,  and  sphingolipids, play a pivotal role in brain function [6]. For instance, fatty acid oxidation contributes 20% of the brain's energy supply  [7],  and  cholesterol  and  sphingolipids  are  major components of lipid rafts [8, 9], playing crucial roles in neurotransmitter  transmission,  signal  transduction,  and neural synaptic plasticity. Alterations in lipid homeostasis  manifest  in  the  early  stages  of  AD  [10],  with  studies indicating abnormal lipid deposition in the brains of AD patients  and  3 × Tg  AD  mice,  signifying  disrupted  lipid metabolism  [11-14].

Metabolic  analysis  of  serum, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid from AD patients reveals the dysregulation of lipid metabolism is closely linked to cognitive decline and neuronal dysfunction [16, 17].\n\nThe  gut  microbiota,  populating  the  human  gastrointestinal tract, consists of approximately 100 trillion bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, collectively  encoding over  3  million  genes  and  generating  a  diverse  array  of metabolites  [18].  Through  the  bidirectional  'gut-brain axis' [19, 20], the gut microbiota actively modulates host metabolic  processes  [21-24].  During  pathological  conditions,  dynamic  alterations  in  the  gut  microbiota  have been  observed  in  tandem  with  the  progression  of  the host's disease [25-27]. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of gut microbiota  in  AD  patients  reveals  a  reduction  in  both abundance and diversity [28-30], such as, the significant correlation between the increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and the severity and progression of AD has been observed [30]. The alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota have also been associated with Aβ and tau  pathological  biomarkers  [31].  Our  study  establishes Helicobacter  pylori (H.  pylori)  infection  as  a  risk  factor for AD [32, 33], 5 × FAD mice [34], and Tauopathy mouse model [25] has been provided. Chandra S and colleagues have  extensively  summarized  these  findings  [35].  Mezö et  al.  found  that  Germ-free  (GF)  5 × FAD mice enhance the  uptake  of  Aβ  deposits  by  hippocampal  microglia,  mitigating  plaque  burden  and  neuronal  loss,  and improving  memory  function  [36].  Antibiotic  treatment in  APP/PS1 mice also led to a reduction in Aβ deposition  [37].  Harach  et  al.  reached  the  same  conclusion  in GF  APP/PS1  mice  [38],  providing  compelling  evidence for  the  role  of  gut  microbiota  in  AD.  Transplanting  gut microbiota from AD mice into wild-type C57BL/6 mice results  in  impaired  memory  function  and  neurogenesis [39].  Conversely,  fecal  microbiota  transplantation  from healthy  mice  effectively  mitigates  Aβ  plaque  deposition and neurofibrillary tangle formation in AD mice, thereby ameliorating  cognitive  impairment  [40].  These  findings underscore the complex involvement of gut microbiota in AD pathology and suggest its potential as a therapeutic avenue for AD.\n\nEmerging evidence suggests a significant interaction  between  gut  microbiota  and  lipid  metabolism  in AD  [41].  Such  as  correlations  were  observed  between gut  microbiota  and  fatty  acids  as  well  as  glycerophospholipids  in  APP/PS1  mice  [42].  A  recent  multi-omics study has unveiled the intricate connection between gut microbiota  and  host  glycerophospholipid  metabolism, as well as neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 mice [43, 44]. Additionally,  gut  microbiota  from  3 × Tg  mice  induced increased pro-inflammatory signal transduction through polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism [45]. Multi-strain probiotic  formulation  resulted  in  reduced  total  cholesterol  levels,  improved  lipid  metabolism,  and  enhanced cognitive  function  [46].  These  findings  present  compelling evidence for the involvement of gut microbiota in the lipid metabolism of AD.\n\nGiven  the  pivotal  roles  of  lipid  metabolism  and  gut microbiota  in  AD,  this  review  systematically  explores the  dysregulation  of  lipid  metabolism  in  the  context  of AD.  Subsequently,  it  emphasizes  the  intricate  interplay between gut microbiota and lipid metabolism during AD pathology, with a specific focus on gut microbiota metabolites, key genes, and molecular mechanisms. Lastly, the paper provides a comprehensive summary and analysis of current research pertaining to strategies aimed at modulating  gut  microbiota  and  lipid  metabolism,  to  improve the pathological progression of AD.",

        "title": "Fatty acids",
        "content": "Fatty  acids,  characterized  by  long  hydrocarbon  chains, are  categorized  into  saturated  fatty  acids  (SFAs)  and unsaturated  fatty  acids  (UFA),  which  encompass  both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) [47]. ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs),  including  docosahexaenoic  acid  (DHA)  and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), as well as ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-6 PUFAs) like arachidonic acid (AA), have been identified to play a significant role in AD [48]. Metabolomic analysis of post-mortem samples from the Baltimore  Longitudinal  Study  of  Aging  (BLSA)  cohort revealed  the  strongest  correlation  between  PUFAs  and AD  [49].  Current  research  suggests  that  ω-3  PUFAs, such as EPA and DHA, exert anti-inflammatory effects, mitigating  Aβ  deposition  and  improving  cognition  in AD  mice  [50].  DHA  as  the  most  abundant  PUFAs  in the  brain,  reduces  amyloid  production  and  inhibits  the aggregation  and  formation  of  amyloidogenic  fibrils  by decreasing  the  activity  of  γ-  and  β-secretase  enzymes, and its levels are significantly reduced in the brains and plasma  of  AD  patients  [49,  51,  52].  In  contrast  to  ω-3 PUFAs, ω-6 PUFAs are recognized as pro-inflammatory precursors, contributing to the synthesis of leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and thromboxane [53]. ω-6 PUFAs activate  GPR40  activation,  which  is  implicated  in  neuronal degeneration  and  death;  thus,  the  excessive  intake  of ω-6 PUFAs is considered a risk factor for AD [54]. AA, a plentiful ω-6 PUFA found in the gray matter of the brain,\n\nexhibits heightened levels in individuals with AD, thereby fostering the generation and accumulation of Aβ through a  series  of  inflammatory  cascades.  Despite  the  prevailing perception of ω-3 PUFAs as protective elements for AD patients, it is crucial to recognize that both ω-3 and ω-6 PUFAs are integral to brain physiology. Therefore, it is imperative to uphold a judicious balance in the intake of ω-6/ω-3 PUFAs for optimal individual well-being [55].\n\nSFAs  are  generally  considered  to  increase  the  risk  of AD [56]. Such as palmitic acid (PA), the most common SFAs in the brain, has been found to have elevated levels  in  the  temporal  and  frontal  cortices  of  AD  patients [57,  58]  PA  induces  SIRT1  dysfunction  and  activates the  NF-κB pathway [59]. Through SIRT1 inhibition, PA indirectly upregulates SREBP1 transcription and expression, leading to β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme  1(BACE1)  promoter  transactivation.  This  cascade results in increased BACE1 expression, heightened enzymatic activity, and elevated amyloid-beta generation. Additionally,  PA  induces  tau  hyperphosphorylation  and neuroinflammation [60].",

        "title": "Cholesterol",
        "content": "In the presence of the blood-brain barrier, cerebral cholesterol primarily originates from endogenous synthesis. In brief, astrocyte-synthesized cholesterol, coupled with apolipoprotein  E  and  J,  is  secreted  through  ATP-binding  cassette  transporters,  followed  by  neuronal  uptake. Excessive  intracellular  free  cholesterol  is  enzymatically converted  into cholesterol ester (CE)  by cholesterol acyltransferase, leading to intracellular accumulation or plasma membrane efflux [5]. Increased brain cholesterol concentrations are regarded as a risk factor for AD due to the robust association with synaptic dysfunction and  impaired  neurotransmission,  as  evidenced  in  brain tissue  from  both  AD  patients  and  mouse  models  [61]. Post-mortem  examinations  of  AD  patients  revealed  an association between hypercholesterolemia and increased accumulation of Aβ in the brain [62]. The observed association could stem from blood-brain barrier impairment, resulting  in  an  augmented  cholesterol  influx  into  the brain  and  exacerbating  the  cerebral  cholesterol  burden. Subsequently, this mechanism accelerates Aβ aggregation within neurons and synaptic loss, thereby aggravating the pathological progression of AD [63].\n\nA cholesterol-binding domain has been reported within the transmembrane domain of amyloid precursor protein  (APP),  suggesting  a  direct  interaction  between cholesterol and APP. Cholesterol upregulates the activity of γ-secretase, promoting the colocalization of APP with γ and β-secretases, thereby stimulating the generation of Aβ [64, 65]. A reduction in cholesterol may enhance nonpathogenic cleavage by α-secretase, consequently reducing Aβ production [66]. In addition, CE can bind to the cholesterol-binding  domain on APP, affecting APP processing and Aβ production. In contrast to the Aβ regulation, CE regulate the phosphorylation of tau in neurons through  a  proteinase-pTau  axis.  The  reduction  in  CE generation leads to a decrease in the expression levels of phosphorylated tau at multiple sites [67].",

        "title": "Phospholipid",
        "content": "Phospholipids form the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, acting  as  a  safeguarding  barrier  for  cellular  and  subcellular  structures.  They  also  participate  in  maintaining homeostasis,  managing  immune  responses,  oxidative stress  and  neuroinflammation  in  the  brain.  The  main brain  phospholipids  are  phosphatidylcholine  (PC)  and phosphatidylethanolamine  (PE)  [68].  There  have  been reports that the lyso-PC to PC ratio decreases, and watersoluble  PC  metabolites  increase  in  individuals  with  AD [69].  Indeed,  increased  levels  of  glycerophosphocholine and decreased levels of lysoPC(18:1(11Z)), PC (16:0/16:0) and phosphatidylcholine were observed in the brains of APP/PS1 transgenic  mice  [43].  This  suggests  that  there is  more  hydrolysis  of  phospholipids  during  the  course of AD. The degradation of PC and PE is considered as a significant metabolic anomaly in AD, with the decreased concentrations being closely associated with the severity of amyloid protein and neurofibrillary pathology [70-72]. Moreover,  there  is  a  substantial  70%  decrease  in  ethanolamine plasmalogens (PlsEtns) in AD patients, which exert  neuroprotective  effects  by  activating  G-protein coupled  receptors  (GPCRs),  increasing  AKT  and  ERK pathway  phosphorylation,  preventing  neuronal  death, reducing γ-secretase activity, and decreasing Aβ production [73, 74]. Additionally, mice deficient in PlsEtns have increased activity of the tau phosphorylating kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β), possibly leading to excessive tau phosphorylation [75].\n\nAnother  noteworthy  phospholipid is Phosphatidylserine  (PtdSer),  constituting  13-15%  of  phospholipids in  the  human  cerebral  cortex  [76].  PtdSer  serves  as  an indispensable  participant  in  signal  transduction,  asymmetrically  distributed  on  the  leaflet  of  the  lipid  bilayer [77]. PtdSer on the inner leaflet of the membrane facilitates  the  activation  of  signaling  proteins  and  receptors crucial for neuronal survival, differentiation, and synaptic neurotransmission [78]. Externalized phosphatidylserine (ePtdSer) serves as one of the ligands for The Triggering Receptor  Expressed  on  Myeloid  Cells  2  (TREM2)  [79]. ePtdSer exposed on synaptic surfaces acts as an 'eat-me' signal, facilitating microglia-mediated synapse pruning  [80]  and  phagocytic  activity  [81].  In  Nondemented individuals with AD neuropathology (NDAN), microglia induced by ePtdSer-TREM2 exhibit enhanced efficiency in  clearing  damaged  synapses,  which  may  underlie  the synaptic  structural  and  functional  integrity  in  NDAN\n\nindividuals,  thus  preventing  cognitive  impairment  [82]. Under  oxidative  stress  conditions  of  AD,  the  asymmetry of PtdSer is disrupted, evidenced by increased exposure of PtdSer in the outer leaflets of the frontal cortex in  individuals  with  Mild  Cognitive  Impairment  (MCI) and AD, initiating early apoptosis and ultimately leading to  increased  neuronal  damage  [77].  Another  study  suggests that in the early stages of AD, the release of ePtdSer  serves  as  an  'eat-me'  signal,  prompting  microglia to  preferentially  eliminate  ePtdSer + damaged  synapses through  TREM2,  thereby  maintaining  neural  and  synaptic  homeostasis.  However,  microglia  expressing  dysfunctional  R47H  TREM2  fail  to  phagocytose  ePtdSer + synapses,  resulting  in  increased  apoptotic-like  synaptic burden in the hippocampus [83].",

Metabolomic  analysis  of  brain  and  blood  in  preclinical and prodromal stages of AD shows a correlation between decreased sphingolipid levels and the severity of AD pathology [71, 85, 86]. Blood sphingolipid concentrations  correlate  with  cerebrospinal  fluid  Aβ  levels,  brain atrophy and cognitive decline, suggesting the potential of sphingolipids as early biomarkers of AD [71].\n\nCeramides which increased in the brain tissue  of  AD patients  [87]  contribute  to  the  stability  of  BACE1  and facilitate  the  excessive  generation  of  Aβ  [88].  Neurons accelerate Aβ aggregation by releasing extracellular vesicles  rich  in  ceramides,  while  inhibition  or  silencing  of neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (nSMase2), which is responsible  for  vesicle  secretion,  has  been  shown  to  improve Aβ plaque formation, slow the pathological progression of AD and improve cognitive function [89]. In addition, S1P,  recognized  for  its  neuroprotective  effects,  exhibits decreased levels in the brain tissues of both AD patients and 5 × FAD mice, potentially accelerating neuronal degeneration [87, 89].",

        "content": "Gut  microbiota  enzymatically  degrades  carbohydrates and  plant  polysaccharides  to  produce  SCFAs,  particularly  acetate,  propionic  acid,  and  butyrate,  which  collectively constitute about 95% of the total SCFAs in the human body. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes preferentially generate  propionate, Firmicutes ( Eubacterium , Anaerostipes , Roseburia ,  and Faecalibacterium  prausnitzii )  are well-defined  as  the  predominant  producers  of  butyrate. Akkermansia muciniphila has the unique ability to utilize intestinal  mucin  as  its  sole  carbon  and  nitrogen  source for proliferation, with propionate as a central metabolite. These  SCFAs  have  the  capacity  to  traverse  the  bloodbrain  barrier  or  the  gut-brain  axis,  exerting  regulatory effects on neurotransmitter synthesis, mitochondrial function, lipid metabolism, and gene expression [44].\n\nTargeted  metabolomics  analysis  of  feces  from  AD patients indicates a reduction in the levels of SCFAs-producing phyla such as Firmicutes , Clostridia , and Ruminococcus ,  resulting  in  decreased  SCFAs levels [91]. SCFAs play a pivotal role in AD pathology through Ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) signaling [92]. Specifically,  SCFAs  bind  to  GPR43  and  GPR109A  receptors, modulate cholesterol and lipid metabolism, activate MAPK pathway,  and  suppress  NF-κB  pathway  [93].  In addition,  studies  have  explored  the  functions  and  roles of individual SCFA in AD, such as, acetate up-regulates GPR41  expression,  inhibits  the  ERK/JNK/NF-κB  pathway,  alleviates  neuroinflammation,  and  improves  cognition  in  APP/PS1 mice [94]. Additionally, propionic acid binds  to  GPR41  in  brain  endothelial  cells,  hinders  lowdensity lipoprotein receptor-related protein  1(LRP-1) expression through a CD14-dependent mechanism, and shields the blood-brain barrier from oxidative stress via NRF2  signaling  [95].  Furthermore,  epigenetics  represents  one  of  the  mechanisms  by  which  SCFAs  impact AD.  Butyrate,  acting  as  a  histone  deacetylase  inhibitor, has demonstrated the ability to elevate the expression of genes associated with learning,  restore  histone  acetylation,  and  markedly enhance  learning  and  memory  ability  in  AD  mice  [96], acetate  also  enhances  cognition  by  facilitating  histone H3K18 acetylation [97].\n\nFurthermore,  Colombo  et  al.  observed  a  significant reduction in Aβ plaque burden in the brains of GF APP/ PS1 mice compared to specific pathogen-free (SPF) APP/ PS1 mice, with improved cognitive performance in spatial  memory  tasks.  Subsequent  investigations  revealed\n\nFig. 1 The potential association between gut microbiota and their metabolites with lipid dysregulation in AD. Throughout the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is a reduction in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). PC exhibits a negative correlation with the severity of AD pathology, while PE serves as a prognostic indicator for patients with mild cognitive impairment. Plasmalogens (PlsEtns) mitigate tau phosphorylation and experience downregulation in AD. Cholesterol, a pivotal lipid in AD, notably increases in the brain, accompanied by a significant elevation in cholesterol esters (CE). Cholesterol and CE play pivotal roles in AD, contributing to Aβ pathology, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. Gut microbiota metabolites such as BAs, SCFAs, and LPS interact with cholesterol, thereby modulating AD pathology. Ceramide (Cer) levels escalate in AD, stabilizing BACE1 and fostering Aβ production, whereas sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) exhibits neuroprotective effects, and its decrease facilitates neurodegeneration. Tryptophan metabolites (TRYCATs) are intricately associated with sphingolipids through the AhR receptor. Fatty acids like docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) decrease in AD, playing a role in inhibiting Aβ generation. Arachidonic acid (AA) is a prominent participant in neuroinflammation, instigating neuronal degeneration. Palmitic acid (PA), a representative saturated fatty acid, fosters AD through heightened β-secretase activity and tau hyperphosphorylation. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) exacerbates AD progression by promoting fatty acid oxidation and oxidative stress\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthat the increased concentration of SCFAs in the plasma of SPF mice was the primary cause of this outcome, contrary to prior findings; supplementation of SCFAs simulated the role of the microbiota and increased Aβ plaque burden [98]. Erny and colleagues also demonstrated that acetate treatment exacerbated Aβ plaque deposition and neuroinflammation in GF 5 × FAD mice [99]. In addition, recent  investigation  demonstrated  that  SCFAs  act  as mediators in the neuroinflammation-neurodegeneration axis, intensifying reactivity in neural glial cells and exacerbating  p-tau  pathology  in  TE4  P301S  tau  transgenic mice [100]. Nevertheless, the experimental findings reported by Zhou et al. indicate that dietary supplementation  with  high  acetate  and  butyrate  (HAMSAB)  may attenuate  cognitive  decline  in  5 × FAD mice [101],  highlighting a potential protective role of endogenous SCFA. These  findings  suggest  the  paradoxical  roles  and  functions of SCFAs in AD under different circumstances. Further studies are essential to gain a deeper understanding of the effects of SCFAs on AD. While the role of SCFAs remains controversial,  their  significance  as  key  molecular  mediators in the gut-brain axis of AD is undeniable.\n\nModulation  of  SCFAs  and  their  related  pathways  may represent  promising  therapeutic  targets  in the early peripheral circulation of AD.",

        "content": "Bile acids (BAs) can be further subdivided into primary Bas and secondary Bas; the primary Bas consist of cholic  acid  (CA)  and  chenodeoxycholic  acid  (CDCA)  [102, 103]. The bile salt hydrolase, which are produced in the intestine by Bacteroides , lostridium cluster VIA, Lactobacillus , and Bifidobacterium , transform primary bile acids into secondary bile acids, which include deoxycholic acid (DCA),  lithocholic  acid  (LCA),  and  cholic  ursodeoxycholic  acid  (UDCA)  [102,  104].  Primary  bile  acids  are responsible for lipid absorption and maintaining cholesterol homeostasis, as they can penetrate the blood-brain barrier  (BBB)  and  bind  to  nuclear  receptors  to  regulate brain  physiological  functions.  A  multicenter  metabolomic study involving 1464 participants found that in the serum  metabolome  of  AD  patients,  DCA  and  its  conjugated  forms  with  glycine  and  taurine  increased,  and deoxycholic acid was associated with decreased cognitive abilities  [104].  Another  metabolomic  analysis  revealed that  the  alternative  synthesis  pathway  of  bile  acids  is more active in individuals with AD, and increased serum concentrations of cytotoxic bile acids [103, 105], indicating that dysregulation of bile acid metabolism caused by gut microbiota imbalance is involved in the pathological process of AD.\n\nIn  addition,  some  BAs  have  been  reported  to  exhibit neuroprotective effects. A recent systematic review summarized  that  UDCA  reduces  the  levels  of  ROS,  tumor necrosis  factor  alpha  (TNFα),  and  interleukin-1  beta (IL-1β), exerting anti-apoptotic, oxidative stress and inflammatory  effects  in  AD  [106].  In  addition,  tauroursodeoxycholic  acid  (TUDCA)  reduces  Aβ  deposition, inhibits  the  progression  of  amyloid  pathology  and  suppresses GSK3β activity, thereby reducing tau hyperphosphorylation and microglial cell activation [107]. Further research has confirmed that TUDCA can bind to the G protein-coupled  bile  acid  receptor  1/Takeda  G  proteincoupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) in microglial cells, increasing  cAMP  levels,  inducing  an  anti-inflammatory phenotype of microglial cells, and attenuating inflammatory responses [108]. These findings indicate the potential therapeutic effects of TUDCA in AD [109, 110].",

        "title": "Lipopolysaccharides",
        "content": "Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), endotoxins produced by intestinal gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli , Bacteroides fragilis , and Salmonella enterica , were found to  coexist  with E.  coli fragments  in  amyloid  plaques  in postmortem brain tissues of AD patients [111]. Furthermore, the blood levels of LPS were significantly increased in AD patients, and the presence of LPS was also detected in the neocortex and hippocampus of AD patients at levels  more  than  seven  times  higher  than  control  subjects [112]. These findings indicate that LPS is widely present in the brains of AD patients and may represent a risk factor for cognitive impairment and the progression of AD [113].\n\nThe role of LPS in the pathophysiology of AD has been extensively documented [113]. LPS can disrupt the intestinal and blood-brain barriers, triggering a robust inflammatory response in the brain, promoting Aβ deposition, and inducing excessive phosphorylation of tau [111, 114]. Furthermore,  it  upregulates  the  activity  of  APP  cleaving enzyme BACE-1 and γ-secretase while reducing the activity of α-secretase, thus promoting Aβ generation. It also  induces  neuroinflammation  in  microglia  cells  and impairs cognitive function of AD mice in a CatB-dependent  manner  [115].  Meanwhile,  LPS  downregulates  the expression  of  LRP-1,  impairs  P-glycoprotein  function, and  disrupts  Aβ  clearance  through  multiple  pathways. LRP-1  is  the  primary  metabolic  receptor  for  APOE  in the  brain  and  involved  in  APOE-mediated  lipid  transport processes [116], indicating that LPS may indirectly regulate the function of APOE. Additionally, LPS induces oxidative  stress  and  mitochondrial  dysfunction  through NOX2,  leading  to  neuronal  damage  and  synaptic  loss [113].\n\nFurthermore, an important point not to be overlooked regarding LPS is its close association with microglial activation and neuroinflammation [117, 118]. LPS serves as a receptor agonist for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is  considered  one  of  the  key  receptors  involved  in  the innate immune system of microglia [119], promoting the production  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  and  increasing Aβ accumulation [120]. Additionally, LPS can interact with  TREM2  to  modulate  microglial  phenotype  transition from anti-inflammatory to pro-inflammatory [121]. Therefore, LPS-induced neuroinflammation is also a crucial factor in promoting neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in AD.\n\nFrom the perspective of lipid metabolism, research has shown that LPS can induce the expression of microglial Cholesterol  25-hydroxylase  (CH25H)  [122].  CH25H  is an  enzyme  responsible  for  hydroxylating  cholesterol  to produce oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), which is upregulated in brain tissues of AD patients, as well as in  APP/PS1 and PS19 mouse brain tissues [123]. Regulation  of  CH25H  by  LPS  results  in  increased  synthesis and release of 25-HC, which in turn activates LXR gene expression  and  inhibits  SREBP  expression,  enhancing cholesterol esterification and lipid droplet accumulation in astrocytes [124]. Further studies have found that LPSmediated activation of 25-HC disrupts mouse hippocampal plasticity and memory learning function [122]. Given\n\nthe evidence that Gram-negative bacteria and LPS impact various AD pathologies, Gram-negative bacteria and LPS represent attractive novel targets for AD therapy.",

        "content": "The  anaerobic  bacteria  in  the  gut  microbiota,  such  as Clostridia and Enterobacteriaceae , degrade  carnitine, choline, and lecithin to produce trimethylamine (TMA), which is subsequently oxidized and reduced in the liver to generate Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) [103, 125]. Elevated levels of TMAO have been found in the cerebrospinal  fluid  of  patients  with  mild  cognitive  impairment and AD, and are associated with pathological markers of AD  including  tau  phosphorylation,  Aβ  deposition,  and neurodegeneration [126].\n\nTMAO  activates the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome to induce inflammatory responses  through  SIRT3-SOD2-mtROS  pathway  [127]. TMAO  also  influences  lipid  and  hormone  homeostasis,  regulates  cholesterol  and  steroid  metabolism,  and reduces  cholesterol  reverse  transport,  thereby  promoting  the  development  of  various  diseases  [128].  Furthermore, TMAO affects the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle by decreasing ketone and fatty acid oxidation, thus lowering  energy  metabolism  and  inhibiting  mitochondrial function.  Researchers  observed  that  TMAO  promotes the  downregulation  of  synaptic  plasticity-related  proteins  and  mTOR  signaling  pathway  expression,  leading to  mitochondrial  damage  and  superoxide  production, impairing synapses, and causing a decline in mice cognitive function [129]. Decreasing plasma TMAO levels has been  shown  to  reduce  the  expression  of  pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, IL-17, and TNF-α, alleviate the hippocampal inflammation in APP/PS1 mice, and improve the cognitive ability and pathological progression [130].",

        "content": "Tryptophan (TRP), an indispensable aromatic amino acid obtained from dietary source [131], undergoes regulation by the intestinal microbiota [132]. Through liquid chromatography  metabolomics  analysis,  significant  differences were found in tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs) between AD patients and healthy controls,  indicating  a link  between  cognitive  impairment  in  AD  patients  and dysregulated tryptophan metabolism resulting from microbial imbalance [91]. TRYCATs have been shown to stimulate  neurogenesis  in  mice  through  an  aryl  hydrocarbon  receptor  (AhR)-dependent  manner  [133,  134]. Furthermore,  AhR  is  intricately  linked  to  sphingolipid metabolism, as it upregulates sphingolipid and S1P levels,  thereby  contributing  to  the  maintenance  of  axonal myelination [135, 136]. These findings suggest a potential connection between tryptophan metabolism and sphingolipid metabolism in AD.\n\nIndole,  the  principal  microbial  metabolite  originating  from  tryptophan  degradation  in  adult  organisms, assumes a crucial neuroprotective role in AD by modulating  inflammatory  responses,  preserving  gut  barrier integrity,  and  regulating  immune  homeostasis  [137]. Notably,  a  diminished  abundance  of  indole-producing bacteria, including Firmicutes , Bacteroidetes , Actinobacteria ,  and Lactobacilli ,  was  observed  in  AD  patients [91],  concomitant with a significant reduction in indole levels  [138].  Indole-3-propionic  acid  (IPA),  synthesized by Clostridium sporogenes , is capable of intestinal absorption and entry into the brain, where it serves to scavenge hydroxyl radicals,  reduce  DNA damage, and inhibit the formation  of  amyloid  fibrils  [137].  Indole  compounds exhibit  neuroprotective  effects  due  to  their  antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,  immunomodulatory,  and  anti-amyloidogenic  properties,  gradually  emerging  as  candidate drugs  for  improving  neurodegenerative  diseases.  Relevant  drug  development  efforts  are  currently  underway [139]. The indole compound NC009-1 has been shown to improve cognitive deficits of 3 × Tg-AD mice by upregulating the expression of APOE and tropomyosin receptor kinase A and reducing the levels of Aβ and tau in the hippocampus and cortex [140].\n\nBesides,  metabolomic  analyses,  both  untargeted  and targeted, of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) derived from individuals with AD unveiled a specific dysregulation in the tryptophan-kynurenic  acid  pathway  within  the  central nervous  system.  Notably,  tryptophan  catabolic  metabolites,  namely  kynurenic  acid  and  quinolinic  acid,  exhibited  elevated  concentrations in the CSF of AD patients. Moreover, these metabolites demonstrated a robust correlation  with  the  core  pathological  amyloid  proteins Aβ42 and phosphorylated Tau181 [141].",

        "title": "Gut microbiota metabolites interact with key genes of AD lipid metabolism",
        "content": "Genome-wide  association  studies  (GWAS)  have  pinpointed  risk  genes  for  AD,  including  apolipoprotein  E (APOE),  clusterin  (also  referred  to  as  apolipoprotein  J, CLU), and ATP-binding cassette sub-family A, members 1  and  7  (ABCA1/7).  These  genes  play  a  central  role  in lipid  metabolism  and  their  alterations  contribute  to  the development of lipid metabolism disorders in AD [142144].  Furthermore,  SREBP-2  is  also  a  key  regulator  of cholesterol metabolism and is genetically associated with an altered risk of AD [145]. Numerous studies indicates that the gut microbiota and its metabolites interact with these key lipids genes and participate in the pathological progression of AD (Fig. 2). Therefore, this section focuses on summarizing the above-mentioned content.\n\nFig. 2 The connection mechanisms between gut microbiota and pathology of Alzheimer's disease. The dysregulation of gut microbiota compromises the integrity of the intestinal and blood-brain barriers, allowing gut microbiota metabolites to enter the central nervous system and participate in the pathological processes of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Astrocytes within the central nervous system synthesize lipids through key genes such as SREBP , APOE, ABCA1, CLU, ABCA7, TREM2, transferring them to neurons and microglial cells. Microbial metabolites can interact with these genes, influencing lipid homeostasis. Furthermore, gut microbiota metabolites primarily contribute to AD pathology through involvement in Aβ pathology, tau pathology, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and epigenetic regulation. SCFAs binding to GPR41, dependent on CD14 expression, inhibits NRF2 signaling, reducing oxidative stress in endothelial cells, maintaining the blood-brain barrier. In contrast, LPS binding to TLR4 promotes Myd88 expression, activating NF-κB transcription, releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, damaging the blood-brain barrier. For Aβ Pathology: LPS reduces α-secretase activity, promoting APP production, while both LPS and TMAO upregulate BACE-1 and γ-secretase activities, enhancing Aβ production. SCFAs and TUDCA promote α-secretase activity and inhibit Aβ generation. Tau Pathology: SCFAs and TUDCA inhibit GSK-3β activity by promoting AKT phosphorylation, thereby suppressing tau phosphorylation, and reducing NFTs formation. Neuroinflammation: SCFAs upregulate GPR41 expression, inhibit the ERK/JNK/NF-κB pathway, reducing COX2 and IL-1β levels, alleviating neuroinflammation. TUDCA binds to the TGR5 receptor in microglial cells, increases cAMP levels, inhibits the NF-κB pathway, induces an anti-inflammatory phenotype, and mitigates inflammation. Indole reduces NLRP3 inflammasome expression through the AhR/NF-κB pathway, decreasing the release of inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-18, inhibiting microglia-induced neuroinflammation. TREM2 activates the PI3K/AKT/Foxo3a pathway, suppressing the inflammatory response. Conversely, downregulation of TREM2 expression by LPS leads to an increased inflammatory response. LPS also activates TLR4 and NF-κB transcription, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β. Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Function: SCFAs binding to GPR109A blocks NF-κB signaling, reducing neuronal oxidative stress levels. SCFAs binding to sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter 1 (SMCT1) or activating GPR41 promotes NRF2, leading to increased SOD1 production and inhibition of NOX2, preventing excessive accumulation of neuronal ROS. Indole binds to respiratory chain complex enzymes, reducing mitochondrial electron leakage, neutralizing hydroxyl radicals, and inhibiting ROS production. Epigenetic Regulation: SCFAs inhibit HDAC activity, promoting excessive acetylation of histone H3K18, improving cognition. Alternatively, SCFAs promote histone acetylation, restoring synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in an ACSS2-dependent manner\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "content": "APOE functions as a lipid transport protein with a crucial  role  in  the  central  nervous  system,  and  its  significance and functions in the context of Alzheimer's disease have been extensively documented in numerous research studies  [146-149].  APOE  facilitates  the  transport  of cholesterol  and  lipids  between  astrocytes  and  neurons by interacting with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and LDLR-related protein 1 (LRP1). This mechanism is pivotal in synaptic formation and tissue repair\n\nprocesses  [147].  With  its  three  main  isoforms,  APOE exhibits a range of effects. APOE2 exhibiting a protective effect,  APOE3  playing  a  neutral  role,  while  the  APOE4 allele  increases  the  risk  of  developing  AD  by  approximately 12 times in homozygous individuals [150]. Consequently, APOE4 is considered the most potent risk factor for  late-onset  Alzheimer's  disease  (LOAD)  [114,  151, 152].\n\nIn-depth  analyses  of  the  gut  microbiota  in  AD  mice with  different  APOE  genotypes,  utilizing  16S  rRNA sequencing  and  fecal  metabolomics,  have  revealed  correlations  between  APOE  genotypes  and  the  abundance of  gut  microbiota.  Specifically,  APOE2  genotype  mice displayed higher levels of Ruminococcaceae and Prevotellaceae ,  bacterial families involved in SCFAs production. This  is  thought  to  contribute  to  the  protective  effect  of the  APOE2  genotype  against  AD.  In  APOE4  genotype AD  mice,  an  increase  in Lachnospiraceae and Deferribacteraceae ,  and  a  decrease  in Bacteroidaceae were observed,  accompanied  by  reduced  concentrations  of SCFAs and their precursors [153]. These findings suggest that  APOE  genotypes  influence  the  composition  of  the gut microbiota and the generation of metabolites in AD mice.  Changes  of  microbiota  and  metabolites  induced by  different  APOE  genotypes  may  play  an  important role in the impact of APOE genes on AD. Carriers of the APOEε4  allele  often  experience  disturbances  in  CNS cholesterol  homeostasis,  and  APOE4  mice  also  exhibit abnormal  cholesterol  levels  and  lipid  metabolism  disruptions [153]. This suggests that the gut microbiota and SCFAs may influence CNS cholesterol levels by affecting APOE gene.\n\nMoreover,  the  microbiota  and  its  metabolites  also influence APOE genes. For instance, the microbiota-produced secondary bile acid TUDCA reduce the expression of APOE in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, inhibiting  the  production  and  accumulation  of  Aβ  [154].  In the presence of melatonin, APOE4's characteristics shift from promoting amyloid fibril formation to inhibiting it [137]. Additionally, the gut microbiota reduces neuroinflammation, tau pathology, and neurodegeneration in an APOE  genotype-specific  manner  [100].  These  findings highlight  the  significant  interplay  between  the  microbiota, its metabolites, and APOE genes in AD.",

        "content": "TREM2  is  a  transmembrane  receptor  of  the  immunoglobulin  superfamily  specifically  expressed  in  microglial  cells  of  the central nervous system. It plays a role in microglial proliferation, transportation, phagocytic functions,  and  inflammatory  responses  [155,  156].  When functional  loss  mutations,  such  as  R47N,  R62H,  and D87N,  occur  in  TREM2,  the  risk  of  developing  LOAD increases. These mutations result in reduced cholesterol clearance  by  microglial  cells,  decreased  uptake  of  CLU, LDL,  and  Aβ,  exacerbating  cholesterol  lipid  accumulation,  amyloid  pathology,  and  neuronal  damage  [81, 157-159].\n\nResearch  has  reported  a  close  association  between bacterial anionic LPS and TREM2. LPS bind to TREM2 [160],  promoting  the  transition  of  microglial  cells  from an  anti-inflammatory  phenotype  to  a  pro-inflammatory phenotype  [161].  A  study  in  BV2  cells  confirmed  that LPS  reduces  TREM2  expression,  promotes  the  translocation  of  Foxo3a  from  the  cytoplasm  to  the  nucleus, triggering an inflammatory response. Conversely, upregulation  of  TREM2  expression  can  activate  the  PI3K/ AKT/Foxo3a axis, inhibiting pro-inflammatory factors  and  shifting  microglial  cells  toward  an  M1  phenotype  [162].  Moreover,  TREM2  facilitates  the  expression of  Sirtuin3,  suppressing  LPS-induced  oxidative  stress and  neuroinflammation  [163].  The  deletion  of  TREM2 results in a substantial increase in inflammatory mediators, including Cxcl10, Rac2, and Casp1, upon exposure to  LPS,  thereby  fostering  the  initiation  of  inflammatory responses [164].",

        "content": "ATP-binding  cassette  subfamily  A  (ABCA)  belongs  to the  ATP-binding  cassette  transporter  family,  mediating the export of cholesterol and phospholipids in the brain. Notably, rare variants of ABCA1 and ABCA7 have been identified  as  risk  genes  for  AD  [64].  ABCA1  transports cholesterol,  phospholipids, and other lipid molecules to lipoprotein carriers [165] and facilitates the distribution of cholesterol from astrocytes to neurons, protecting cells from the toxic effects of excessive free cholesterol [166]. Simultaneously, ABCA1 is responsible for lapidating the APOE  protein  in  the  brain.  The  deficiency  of  ABCA1 results in impaired APOE lipidation, leading to increased Aβ  plaque  load,  while  overexpression  of  ABCA1  can reduce  Aβ  deposition  [167,  168].  Research  indicates that  the  gut  microbiota  metabolite  butyrate  activates the expression of ABCA1, promoting cholesterol efflux, thereby  improving  lipid  metabolism  in  APOE -/ -mice [169].  TMAO  has  been  demonstrated  to  downregulate the  expression  of  ABCA1,  promoting  cholesterol  accumulation [170, 171].\n\nABCA7, sharing  54%  homology  with  ABCA1,  is  currently recognized for its involvement in facilitating lipid transport  from  neurons  to  glial  cells,  providing  protection to neurons against oxidative lipid damage. Ongoing research suggests that ABCA7 also plays a crucial role in cholesterol transport and phagocytosis by microglial cells [172, 173]. Conversely, the absence or functional impairment  of  ABCA7  may  intensify  fatty  acid  consumption, disturb  brain  inflammatory  responses,  reduce  microglial  phagocytic function, and elevate Aβ levels [49, 174].\n\nFurthermore, in the setting of LPS-induced brain inflammation,  ABCA7  haplodeficiency  enhances  the  production of EPA during the acute inflammatory phase, thereby facilitating the resolution of acute inflammation [175].",

Genome-wide  association  studies  have established a significant association between CLU allelic variations  and  the  susceptibility  to  AD.  In  comparison to  control  counterparts,  AD  patients  manifest  notably increased  CLU  levels,  and  empirical  evidence  supports the direct interaction of CLU with Aβ, thereby facilitating the formation of Aβ fibrils [176].\n\nResearchers  have  observed  that  the  deletion  of  the CLU gene alters the abundance and composition of the gut  microbiota,  characterized  by  an  increase  in Bacteroidetes and  a  decrease  in Firmicutes ,  indicating  a  close association between CLU and the gut microbiota [177]. Increased  TMAO  levels  induce  elevated  CLU  protein expression,  consequently  triggering  neuroinflammation and the production of β-secretase and βCTF in the hippocampus,  resulting  in  Aβ  deposition.  Conversely,  the inhibitor  3,3-Dimethyl-1-butanol  reduces  TMAO  levels,  inhibits  CLU  protein  expression,  and  improves hippocampal inflammation and cognition [130]. Treatment with Lactobacillus plantarum has been demonstrated to inhibit  the  production  of  gut  microbiota-derived  TMA and synthesis of TMAO, leading to reduced CLU expression, alleviation of cognitive impairment, and attenuation of neuropathology [178]. Currently, limited evidence supports the connection between CLU and the gut microbiota, necessitating further exploration of their relationship and the roles they play in the progression of AD. Considering the reduction of TMAO production via microbial modulation  may  offer  a  potential  avenue  for  mitigating CLU-mediated lipid homeostasis in AD.",

Additionally, another study validates that SCFAs can enhance the gene  expression  of  SREBP2,  consequently  facilitating hepatic absorption of serum cholesterol and augmenting the excretion of fecal bile acids [183]. In 3 × Tg-AD mice, elevated expression of SREBP1c results in increased cholesterol synthesis.

        "content": "The abnormal deposition of amyloid is a central pathological feature of AD [184]. Aβ, a peptide with a length of 36-43 amino acid residues, is generated through consecutive cleavages of APP by β-secretase (mainly BACE1) and γ-secretase [185, 186], with Aβ40 and Aβ42 being the most  common  in  AD.  The  activities  of  β-secretase  and γ-secretase are highly dependent on the lipid levels in the membrane,  emphasizing  the  close  connection  between Aβ pathology and lipids [186]. Certainly, the generation of  Aβ  takes  place  within  specialized  membrane  microdomains called lipid rafts, which are enriched with cholesterol,  phospholipids,  and  sphingolipids  [186,  187]. Increased  brain  cholesterol  levels  boost  the  activity  of β-secretases  and  γ-secretases  within  lipid  rafts,  suppress α-secretase activity, and stimulate the generation of harmful Aβ [185]. Aggregates of Aβ can directly engage with  cell  membrane  lipids  and  cholesterol,  disrupting membrane  integrity  and  permeability,  fostering  Ca 2 + influx, ultimately resulting in neuronal death [188].\n\nResearch  indicates  that  BAs  produced  by  gut  microbiota  increase  the  permeability  of  both  the  intestinal and  blood-brain  barriers  [189],  facilitating  the  entry  of peripheral  cholesterol  into  the  central  nervous  system. The  elevated  brain  cholesterol  directly  binds  with  APP, promoting the insertion of APP into the lipid raft phospholipid  layer  and  consequently  increasing  the  production of Aβ. Moreover, BAs downregulate the expression of  cholesterol-metabolizing  enzyme  CYP46A  through the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), promoting cholesterol accumulation and increasing Aβ production [190]. LPS,  similar  to  BAs,  have  been  shown  to  enhance  the expression  of  APP,  reduce  the  activity  of  α-secretase,\n\nupregulate the activity of APP-cleaving enzyme BACE-1 and γ-secretase, promoting Aβ generation [115]. Furthermore,  the  gut  microbiota  metabolite  TMAO  has  been implicated in promoting Aβ accumulation in AD mice by increasing  the  activity  of  β-secretase  through  elevating CLU levels, leading to cognitive impairment [130].",

Hence,  tau  pathology  is  also considered  a  major  driving  factor  in  the  neurodegenerative  changes  associated  with  AD  [1].  Evidence  suggest that cholesterol and lipoprotein particles impact the excessive  phosphorylation  of  tau  in  neurons  [193].  Further investigations reveal that CE induce tau phosphorylation  through  the  CE-proteasome-tau  axis.  Inhibiting cholesterol  synthesis  in  astrocytes  significantly  reduces the neuronal tau burden [67, 193]. These studies confirm that  disrupted  cholesterol  metabolism  influences  tau pathology of AD.\n\nIn a recent study, researchers subjected tau transgenic mice expressing different APOE isoforms to GF housing and antibiotic interventions. They found that modulation of  gut  microbiota  reduced  tau  pathology,  and  neurodegeneration  in  an  APOE  genotype-dependent  manner. Supplementation with SCFAs exacerbated tau pathology in GF-TE4 mice [100]. Additionally, increased abundance of the Bacteroides fragilis upregulates the PUFA metabolites  PGE1  and  12-HHTrE,  triggering  C/EBPβ/AEP  signaling  activation,  and  exacerbating  tau  pathology  [194]. Lactobacillus  plantarum DP189  increases  the  presence of Firmicutes and, through the modulation of the PI3K/ AKT/GSK3β  pathway,  decreases  the  levels  of  GSK3β, effectively  suppressing  tau  hyperphosphorylation  [195].

In this  context,  misfolded  and  aggregated  proteins  bind  to pattern  recognition  receptors,  such  as  Toll-like  receptors  (TLRs),  located  on  the  surfaces  of  microglial  and astrocytic cells, initiating inflammatory responses. Acute inflammatory responses are believed to contribute to the clearance of Aβ, restoring tissue homeostasis. However, sustained inflammation induced by persistent Aβ stimulation  and  immune  activation  leads  to  the  continuous release  of  pro-inflammatory  factors  and  inflammatory mediators, increasing Aβ deposition and promoting the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, thereby exacerbating neuronal  and  synaptic  damage  and  contributing  to  the progression of AD [197]. Indeed, the critical role of neuroinflammation in AD has been reported as early as the year 2000 [198].\n\nCurrent research has elucidated the impact of the gut microbiota  on  neuroinflammation  in  AD.  The  potential  connection  between  the  microbiota  and  AD  may involve  an  imbalance  in  gut  homeostasis,  characterized  by  an  increase  in  inflammatory  responses  and  a reduction in anti-inflammatory  microbes  [196,  199]. Microbiota analysis in AD patients reveals an increased abundance  of  pro-inflammatory  bacterial  groups  and a  decrease  in  butyrate-producing  taxa  such  as Butyrivibrio , Eubacterium , Clostridium sp . strain SY8519 , and Faecalibacterium  prausnitzii [200].  In  3 × Tg  mice, similar  phenomenon is observed, where beneficial antiinflammatory  bacterial  groups,  such  as Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria ,  gradually  decrease  with  age,  while  proinflammatory  taxa,  including Bacteroidetes and Ruminococcus ,  significantly  increase  [45].  Furthermore,  there is  a  close  association  between  gut  microbiota  and  their metabolites  with  the  activation  of  glial  cells  [201,  202]. Gut  microbiota  can  stimulate  glial  cells  to  participate in  the  neuroinflammatory  response  in  AD  [203,  204]. For  instance,  antibiotic  treatment  in  APP/PS1  mice  has been shown to reduce neuroglial reactivity, thereby alleviating Aβ plaque deposition [37, 205]. Acetate has been shown to upregulate the expression of GPR41 in microglial  cells,  inhibit  the  ERK/JNK/NF-κB  pathway,  reduce the  levels  of  COX2  and  IL-1β,  counteract  neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 mice, and improve cognitive abilities [94]. LPS, by activating the microglial cell surface TLR4 receptor, triggers downstream NF-κB transcription, leading to the activation of numerous pro-inflammatory factors such as TNFα, IL-6, and pro-IL-1β [114]. Indole acts through the AhR-NF-κB pathway, decreasing the expression  of  NLRP3  inflammasomes,  reducing  the  release  of inflammatory  cytokines  TNF-α,  IL-6,  IL-1β,  and  IL-18, alleviating  inflammation,  and  improving  cognitive  and behavioral abilities in APP/PS1 mice [138].\n\nThe  gut  microbiota  may  influence  neuroinflammatory  responses  in  AD  by  affecting  lipid  metabolism.  In brief,  activation  of  the  C/EBPβ/AEP  signaling  pathway by the gut microbiota in the brains of 3 × Tg mice upregulates  mRNA  transcription  for  inflammatory  enzymes related to AA [206], resulting in increased release of AA metabolites  such  as  prostaglandin  E2  (PGE2),  thromboxane B2, LKB4, and 12-HHT. This activation triggers microglial cell activation and intensifies neuroinflammation,  ultimately  worsening  cognitive  impairment.  Further  investigations  revealed  that  specific  gut  bacteria, including Bacteroides  intestinalis , Bacteroides  fragilis ,\n\nand Bacteroides  xylanisolvens ,  produce  AA  metabolites and  contribute  to  AD  neuroinflammatory  responses. Conversely, a decrease in the abundance of anti-inflammatory SCFAs, due to reduced levels of Butyrivibrio and Eubacterium ,  exacerbates  chronic  neuroinflammation, elevates  APP and tau expression levels, and contributes to  AD  pathogenesis  [45].  In  a  recent  study,  the  authors identified  that Bacteroides  fragilis and  its  metabolites, 12-hydroxy-17-carbon-triene acid and PGE2, mediate PUFA metabolism in the gut microbiota of AD. This activation  leads  to  microglial  cell  induction  of  AD-like pathology  and  cognitive  impairments  [194],  providing compelling evidence for the role of gut microbiota in regulating AD lipid metabolism and neuroinflammation.",

        "title": "Oxidative stress",
        "content": "Oxidative stress refers to the imbalance in cellular redox equilibrium caused by the accumulation of reactive oxygen  species  (ROS)  and  reactive  nitrogen  species  (RNS). ROS play a vital role in normal physiological conditions by  participating  in  signaling  pathways  and  transcriptional activation. Nevertheless, continuous accumulation of  ROS, coupled with compromised cellular antioxidant capacity, can result in the assault on cellular macromolecules  such  as  lipids,  proteins,  and  DNA.  This  process leads to lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and nucleic acid damage [207, 208]. Concurrently, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction disturb redox balance, fostering the generation and release of ROS [209]. The elevation of ROS and oxidative stress is recognized as one of the hallmarks of AD.\n\nThe central event of oxidative stress is lipid peroxidation, and the brain, rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, is susceptible  to  oxidative  stress  due  to  lipid  peroxidation [210]. SCFAs play a crucial role in regulating lipid peroxidation. For example, butyrate enhances fatty acid oxidation,  electron transport chain, and oxidative stress gene expression,  while  propionate  interacts  with  fatty  acid receptors,  upregulating  lipoprotein  lipase  to  promote lipid synthesis [211, 212]. Acetate is involved in regulating cholesterol metabolism and adipogenesis [213]. Thus, existing  evidence  supports  the  role  of  gut  microbiota in  mediating  oxidative  stress  alterations  in  AD  [208]. Propionate  bind  to  the  free  fatty  acid  receptor  GPR41 in  brain  endothelial  cells,  inhibiting  the  expression  of LRP-1 through a  CD14-dependent  mechanism,  and protecting the blood-brain barrier from oxidative stress through NRF2 signaling [95]. Butyrate act as ligands for GPR109A,  and  by  activating  GPR109A,  they  block  the NF-κB signaling pathway [212], a crucial pathway in oxidative stress in AD [214, 215]. Additionally, cells uptake butyrate  through  the  sodium-coupled  monocarboxylate  transporter  1  (SMCT1),  leading  to  the  generation of  Sp1.  This  activation  of  Sp1  stimulates  NRF2,  thereby promoting  the  production  of  SOD1  and  suppressing NOX2, preventing the excessive accumulation of reactive ROS in neurons [216]. Indole derivative IPA, an effective scavenger of hydroxyl radicals, protects central neurons from  oxidative  damage  by  reducing  DNA  damage  and lipid peroxidation [212].",

        "content": "Various  pieces  of  evidence  indicate  that  mitochondrial dysfunction is an early event in the pathogenesis of AD, including  alterations  in  mitochondrial  structure,  respiratory  dysfunction,  reduced  ATP  generation,  impaired dynamics,  and  elevated  mitochondrial-associated  oxidative stress [192, 217, 218]. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to the release of cytochrome c, which activates Caspase-9-dependent  neuronal  apoptosis,  disrupting  Ca 2 + homeostasis and triggering neuronal death. The association  between  the  gut  microbiota  and  mitochondria  has been  extensively  documented  over  an  extended  period [219, 220]. Microbial metabolite N6-carboxymethyllysine (CML)  mediates  ROS  burst,  damaging  mitochondrial activity and ATP storage in microglial cells [221]. Butyrate  enhances  mitochondrial  biogenesis  in  astrocytes  by upregulating the expression of PGC-1A, contributing to improved  mitochondrial  function  and  enhanced  cognitive abilities in AD mice [222]. IPA and indole-3-propionamide (IPAM) exert neuroprotective effects by mitigating mitochondrial electron leakage and neutralizing hydroxyl radicals. Moreover, indole compounds, including IPA and IPAM, permeate the  mitochondrial  membrane,  binding to  the  rate-limiting  phosphorylation  site  on  respiratory chain complex I. This action serves as an energy metabolism stabilizer, leading to a reduction in ROS production and contributing to neuroprotection [137].",

        "title": "Epigenetic regulation",
        "content": "Epigenetic regulation encompasses processes such as histone modification, DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA regulation, all of which have been  demonstrated  to  play  a  crucial  role  in  neurodegenerative  diseases  [92,  93].  It  is  well-established  that the  expression  levels  of  key  proteins  implicated  in  AD, including  APP,  BACE1,  PS1,  and  APOE,  are  subject  to epigenetic  regulation.  Therefore,  the  imbalance  in  epigenetic regulation may underlie the aberrant expression of genes associated with synaptic plasticity and memory in  AD  [223].  Histone  modification  is  a  common  form of  epigenetic  regulation  in  AD,  influencing  the  stability  of  nucleosomes,  chromatin-mediated  processes  to participate in the regulation of gene expression. Histone modification encompasses acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, among  others, with acetylation playing  a  crucial  role  in  AD  [224].  Research  has  revealed  a reduction  in  H4K12  histone  acetylation  levels  in  aged\n\nmice,  leading  to  defects  in  the  expression  of  learning and  memory-related  genes  [225].  Histone  acetylation  is regulated  by  histone  acetyltransferases  (HATs)  and  histone deacetylases (HDACs). In AD mice and patients, the expression of HDAC2 increases with age [226]. HDAC2 overexpression  reduces  dendritic  spine  density,  impairs neural plasticity and memory function, and suppressing or downregulating HDAC expression effectively restores cognitive function in AD animals [227].\n\nButyrate is described as a HDAC inhibitor, improving memory  function  in  APP/PS1  mice  by  enhancing  hippocampal histone acetylation [96]. Acetate enhances histone H3K18 over-acetylation and epigenetic regulation of BDNFPII and PIV promoter regions, leading to increased expression of BDNF and improvement in cognition [97]. Furthermore, acetate supplementation, as demonstrated in  5 × FAD mice, enhances histone  acetylation,  restoring synaptic  plasticity  and  cognitive  function  in  an  ACSS2dependent  manner  [228].  Studies  have  reported  that the immature phenotype of microglia in GF mice arises from  epigenetic  markings  of  key  mitochondrial  genes by H3K4me3 and H3K9ac, accompanied by intracellular fatty acid and lipid depletion. Acetate, driving microglial maturation  and  metabolic  homeostasis,  can  rescue  the impaired microglial  function  in  GF  mice.  In  the  pathological context of AD, acetate exhibits inhibitory effects on  microglial  phagocytic  function,  leading  to  increased Aβ burden in 5 × FAD mice [99].",

        "content": "Probiotics,  as  live  microbial  supplements,  have  been shown  to  effectively  improve  gut  microbiota  balance and  provide  therapeutic  benefits  for  patients  with  AD [229]. Studies have demonstrated the therapeutic effects of  SLAB51  on  AD,  it  improves  glucose  homeostasis, reduces tau phosphorylation  [230],  increases  SCFAs such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, while decreasing inflammation and Aβ deposition [231]. It activates a SIRT1-dependent  mechanism,  reducing  oxidative  stress in the brains of AD mice [232]. Another study found that SLAB51 inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis, lowers the ω-6/ ω-3 fatty acid ratio, improves neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, ultimately reducing Aβ and tau aggregation, and slowing down AD progression [46]. Candida rugosa lipase  (CRL)  has  been  reported  to  increase  the  abundance  of Acetatifactor and Clostridiales  vadin  BB60 in  the  gut,  enhancing  lipid  hydrolysis  and  maintaining unsaturated  fatty  acid  homeostasis,  leading  to  reduced neuroinflammation  and  cognitive  deficits  in  APP/PS1 mic [233]. Lactobacillus plantarum DP189 regulates gut microbiota dysbiosis and inhibits tau hyperphosphorylation, as reported [195]. Additionally, it suppresses TMA production and TMAO synthesis, thereby reducing CLU expression  and  alleviating  neuroinflammation  and  neuropathological defects in APP/PS1 mice [233]. The probiotic VSL#3 efficiently reduces serum prostaglandin and deoxycholic acid levels, ameliorating intestinal inflammation and permeability. Nonetheless, its influence on brain plaque  deposition,  cytokine  levels,  and  gliosis  appears to be relatively limited [234]. Synthesizing this evidence with findings from other studies implies that combining probiotics with exercise could represent a more promising therapeutic strategy for enhancing cognitive function [235, 236]. In summary, probiotics modulate gut microbiota  composition  and  lipid  metabolism  homeostasis, exerting positive effects on brain inflammation, oxidative stress,  Aβ  pathology,  and  tau  pathology.  Therefore,  by regulating  the  microbial  composition  through  probiotics,  new  preventive  and  therapeutic  options  for  AD  are proposed.",

This led  to  elevated  levels  of  docosapentaenoic  acid  (DPA), sphingolipids,  and  PC,  significantly  ameliorating  cognitive  deficits,  Aβ  accumulation,  and  abnormal  activation of hippocampal astrocytes in AD mice [251]. Curcumin reduced  the  abundance  of Prevotellaceae , Bacteroides , and Escherichia/Shigella in  the  gut  of  APP/PS1  mice. In  BV2  microglial  cells,  it  upregulated  the  expression of  TREM2,  alleviating  neuroinflammation  and  amyloid plaque  burden,  thereby  enhancing  cognition  [252,  253]. Bilberry  anthocyanins  (BA)  lowered  serum  and  brain LPS levels, increased SCFAs in feces, induced microglial phagocytosis of Aβ through the CD33/TREM2/TYROBP signaling  pathway,  alleviated  hippocampal  neuroinflammation, and reversed cognitive impairments in APP/PS1 mice [254]. In conclusion, the interaction of polyphenols with the gut-brain axis enables them to influence the central  nervous  system  and  exert  neuroprotective  activity. Further development of their therapeutic potential in AD is warranted.",

        "content": "Herbal medicines (HMs), also known as botanical medicines or phytomedicines, refer to plant-derived materials or preparations with therapeutic or other human health benefits.  Studies  have  reported  that  the  chemical  substances  in  herbal  medicines  can  be  transformed  by  gut microbiota into metabolites, thereby improving the composition, functional impairments, and associated pathological  progress  of  the  gut  microbiota.  The  regulatory effects  of  herbal  medicines  on  the  gut  microbiota  have also  been  applied  in  AD  [255].  Patchouli  alcohol  (PA) has been demonstrated to effectively inhibit pro-inflammatory microbial groups such as Bacteroides , Klebsiella , Bilophila, Proteobacteria , and Enterobacteriaceae . It enhances the abundance of anti-inflammatory microbial groups, such as Firmicutes and Lactobacillus , suppresses the activation of the C/EBPβ/AEP pathway, alleviates Aβ plaque  deposition,  tau  hyperphosphorylation,  and  neuroinflammation,  ultimately  improving  cognitive  deficits in  TgCRND8  mice  [256].  Schisandra  chinensis  (S.  chinensis)  improves  learning  and  memory  abilities  in  AD rats by increasing SCFAs levels and alleviating neuroinflammation  [257].  Alpinae  Oxyphyllae  Fructus  (AOF) has been proven to regulate TREM2 and mitigate LPSinduced neuroinflammation, promoting a beneficial M2 phenotype in microglial cells and ameliorating cognitive impairments  in  mice  [258,  259].  Epimedii  Folium  and Curculiginis Rhizoma, extracts of Horny Goat Weed and Xianmao, enhance TREM2 protein expression in the hippocampus by reducing TNF-α and IL-1β, regulating the transformation  and  activation  of  microglial  cells,  thus improving LPS-induced cognitive impairments [260]. In addition,  Pyrolae  herba  (PH)  regulates  TREM2  expression, inhibits LPS-induced neuroinflammation, and alleviates  cognitive  impairments  [261].  The  therapeutic effects  of  herbal  medicine  on  AD  are  highly  complex, involving multiple aspects, with gut microbiota and lipid metabolism being just one facet. The precise therapeutic mechanisms remain to be elucidated.",

        "title": "Statins",
        "content": "Statins  inhibit  HMG  CoA  reductase  in  the  cholesterol biosynthetic  pathway,  affecting  intracellular  cholesterol distribution,  gene  expression,  and  proteasome  activity. This leads to a reduction in Aβ production, lowering the risk of AD and demonstrating positive effects on cognitive  function.  Beyond  their  well-known  lipid-lowering effects,  statins  may  also  influence  AD  cognitive  function  through  mechanisms involving the gut microbiota. For instance,  atorvastatin  has  been  shown  to  effectively increase the abundance of intestinal Lactobacillus while reducing Blautia and Ruminococcaceae . This modulation of  the  gut-brain  axis  alleviates  neuroinflammation  and improves  cognition.  Both  atorvastatin  and  rosuvastatin increase  the  abundance  of  butyrate-producing  bacteria, such  as Butyricimonas , Bacteroides ,  and Mucispirillum , leading to reduced IL-1β levels and improved inflammation  [262].  Oral  administration  of  simvastatin  has  been demonstrated to enhance gut microbial activity, increase\n\nSCFAs levels in feces, strengthen intestinal cell connections,  and  reduce  cell  death  and  amyloid  plaque  deposition  in  the  hippocampal  tissue  [263].  As  showed  in Table 2. Furthermore, the effects and influences of statins on AD are still under ongoing exploration, with the interaction with gut microbiota being a potential mechanism.",

        "content": "Dietary  patterns  have  been  shown  to  play  a  role  in  AD pathology. The  Western  diet, characterized by high fat,  high  protein,  and  low  fiber  intake,  has  been  associated  with  a  reduced  abundance  of  beneficial  microbial  strains,  including Lactobacillus , Ruminococcaceae , Lachnospiraceae , and SCFA-producing  bacteria such as Ruminococcus  bromii , Faecalibacterium  prausnitzii, Eubacterium  rectale , Eubacterium  hallii ,  and Anaerostipes coli SS2/1 , correlating with an increased risk of AD [266]. In contrast, the Mediterranean diet (MeDi), representing a balanced nutritional pattern rich in unsaturated fatty  acids,  vegetables,  fruits,  and  lean  meat  proteins, has demonstrated the ability to effectively modulate the abundance  of  beneficial  bacteria,  including Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus ,  in the gut, thereby reducing the risk  of  AD  onset  [267].  The  ketogenic  diet  emphasizes very low carbohydrate intake and high-fat foods, exhibiting therapeutic effects in AD patients by modulating gut homeostasis, reducing neuronal overexcitation, enhancing mitochondrial metabolism, and decreasing oxidative stress [268].

The results demonstrated that MMKD increased the abundance of the Phylum Tenericutes and the family Enterobacteriaceae ,  both negatively correlated with the expression levels of Aβ42 in the cerebrospinal  fluid.  This  dietary  approach  also  increased butyrate  levels,  restricted  LPS  diffusion,  promoted  gut barrier stability, effectively restored gut microbiota composition,  enhanced  steroid  biosynthesis,  and  improved AD  pathology  [267].  Therefore,  the  modulation  of  gut microbiota  and  lipid  metabolism  by  dietary  patterns holds significant importance in the prevention of AD and the attenuation of disease progression.",

        "title": "Exercise",
        "content": "Exercise  can  stimulate  the  proliferation  of  'beneficial' microbial communities, maintaining gut microbiota balance  and  subsequently  improving  health  conditions [269].  Consequently, exercise is regarded as an effective and  readily  available  therapeutic  approach,  possibly  the single most important and accessible lifestyle component offering protection against a broad range of diseases [270, 271].  There  is  a  close  association  between  exercise  and the gut-brain axis. Studies have found a negative correlation  between physical activity  and  the  risk  of  AD,  indicating that regular exercise in the elderly can prevent AD and slow cognitive decline. Therefore, exercise serves as both a preventive strategy and an intervention measure in the treatment of AD [272, 273].\n\nA  16-week  running  wheel  exercise  regimen  has  been demonstrated  to  increase  the  abundance  of Firmicutes while  decreasing  the  abundance  of Bacteroidetes and Tenericutes ,  effectively  improving  gut  microbiota  composition  and  memory  [274].  Running  exercise  has  also been shown to increase the microbial content of Eubacteria , Roseburia ,  and Clostridia in the intestines of APP/PS1 mice, while decreasing the abundance of Prevotella , Bacteroides , Bacteroides fragilis , and L. johnsonii . This alteration inhibits the transfer of LPS to the brain, thereby alleviating LPS-induced neuroinflammation and improving  cognitive  function  and  pathological  markers  in  AD  mice  [273,  275].  Moreover,  voluntary  wheel running  (VWR)  exercise  has  been  found  to  upregulate the  abundance  of  phylum Bacteroidetes and  genus Prevotella while  reducing  the  abundance  of  phylum Actinobacteria and TM7 ,  as  well  as  genus Oscillospira and Ruminococcus .  This modulation mitigates cognitive dysfunction induced by TMAO [276]. These studies collectively indicate that exercise serves as an effective measure in  regulating  gut  microbiota  to  improve  the  pathological  progression  of  AD,  presenting  substantial  potential in  both  the  treatment  and  prevention  of  AD.  However, it  is  imperative  to  recognize  that  as  an  intervention  for AD, further research is needed to explore the specifics of exercise protocols, modes, and intensities.",

        "title": "Conclusions and perspectives",
        "content": "As  emphasized  in  this  review,  the  intricate  interplay between  gut  microbiota  and  lipid  metabolism  in  the pathogenesis  of  AD  is  a  noteworthy  research  area.  We summarize  the  current  research  evidence,  highlighting  the  central  role  of  gut  microbiota-derived  metabolites  such  as  SCFAs,  LPS,  TMAO, BAs, and tryptophan indole  derivatives  in  the  lipid  metabolism  disruption  of AD  pathology.  As  the  ultimate  products  of  gut  microbiota,  microbial  metabolites  not  only  interact  with  key lipid metabolism genes such as APOE, TREM2, ABCA1, ABCA7, SREBP1, SREBP2, and CLU but also participate in  AD  lipid  metabolism  and  pathological  processes  by regulating  Aβ  and  tau  pathologies,  neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and epigenetic regulation. These mechanisms are interconnected and mutually influential, and while we have only begun to elucidate their complex pathological associations, the exact underlying mechanisms warrant further in-depth exploration. In future research, the application of omics techniques such as metagenomics, meta transcriptomics, and metabolomics will aid in uncovering the intricate mechanisms  governing  the  relationship  between  lipids,  gut microbiota,  and  AD,  providing  a  deeper  understanding of their interconnections. Moreover, current therapeutic strategies and drugs for AD remain limited, and the close connection between gut microbiota and lipid metabolism provides  new  insights  into  treatment  approaches.  Supplementation  with  potential  beneficial  bacteria  through probiotics,  prebiotics,  and  fecal  microbiota  transplantation may impede or slow the pathological progression of AD. Additionally, the direct impact of diet on the production of microbial metabolites should not be overlooked, emphasizing the importance of dietary regulation. Exercise, as a beneficial lifestyle factor, also holds importance in  the  prevention  of  Alzheimer's  disease.  Polyphenols, herbal  medicines,  and  statin  drugs  demonstrate  neuroprotective effects in the gut microbiota and lipid metabolism of AD, potentially holding translational value.",

        "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapies utilizing amyloid-β (Aβ) immunization have shown potential in clinical trials. Yet, the mechanisms driving Aβ clearance in the immunized AD brain remain unclear. Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to explore the effects of both active and passive Aβ immunization in the AD brain. We compare actively immunized patients with AD with nonimmunized patients with AD and neurologically healthy controls, identifying distinct microglial states associated with Aβ clearance. Using high-resolution spatial transcriptomics alongside single-cell RNA sequencing, we delve deeper into the transcriptional pathways involved in Aβ removal after lecanemab treatment. We uncover spatially distinct microglial responses that vary by brain region. Our analysis reveals upregulation of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 ( TREM2 ) and apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) in microglia across immunization approaches, which correlate positively with antibody responses and Aβ removal. Furthermore, we show that complement signaling in brain myeloid cells contributes to Aβ clearance after immunization. These findings provide new insights into the transcriptional mechanisms orchestrating Aβ removal and shed light on the role of microglia in immune-mediated Aβ clearance. Importantly, our work uncovers potential molecular targets that could enhance A  β-  ta  rg  eted i  mm  un  ot  he  ra  pies, offering new avenues for developing more effective therapeutic strategies to combat AD.\n\nCheck for updates\n\nFor nearly three decades, clinical trials have targeted cerebral Aβ accumulation in AD 1 . Leading strategies include active and passive immunization against Aβ 2 . While these strategies can reduce cerebral Aβ 3-9 , they can also trigger adverse side effects 8-15 . Understanding the cellular mechanisms underpinning Aβ immunization is paramount to improving patient outcomes.\n\npostmortem analyses of AN1792 brains revealed Aβ clearance in some immunized patients, likely via microglia 3-5,16 .  However, the microglial mechanisms dictating Aβ clearance in these brains remain unclear.\n\nThe AN1792 clinical trial was the first to actively immunize patients with AD 3 . This trial utilized immunization against a synthetic Aβ 1-42 peptide. Preclinical studies showed promise, but the trial was suspended after some patients developed aseptic meningoencephalitis 10-12 associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) 4,13 . Our prior\n\ne-mail: dgate@northwestern.edu\n\nThe inflammatory side effects from the AN1792 trial led to a shift toward passive immunization. In passive immunization, patients with AD receive antibodies that target Aβ, such as lecanemab. Lecanemab binds large soluble Aβ protofibrils, reduces Aβ markers and slows cognitive decline in early AD 9 . Our prior case study of a lecanemab-treated patient who developed stroke-like symptoms revealed inflammation in blood vessels with CAA and evidence of Aβ clearance 17,18 . Yet, the\n\nfunction of microglia in Aβ clearance in passive immunization also remains unclear.\n\nIn this study, we used spatial transcriptomics (ST) to analyze the neuroimmune response in AD brains following active and passive Aβ immunization. We compared AN1792-immunized Alzheimer's disease (iAD) brains to nonimmunized Alzheimer's disease (nAD) and control, non-neurologic disease (NND) brains. Additionally, we examined the neuroimmune response in the aforementioned patient treated with lecanemab using high-definition ST, spatial proteogenomics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).\n\nOur  study  uncovers  distinct  microglial  phenotypes  in Aβ-immunized AD brains and reveals genes that control clearance of Aβ by microglia. These results highlight candidate genes to modulate microglial responses in AD immunotherapy.",

        "content": "We utilized ST to analyze brain frontal cortex (FCX) sections of patients with AD from the AN1792 trial (Fig. 1a). This cohort included 13 iAD brains, as well as 6 nAD and 6 NND control brains (Fig. 1b). Extended Data Table 1 details the clinical and pathologic profiles of these individuals. Groups were age matched (Fig. 1c) and sex matched (Extended Data Fig. 1a). A 6.5 × 6.5-mm ST capture area (4,992 spots) was analyzed, and ST spots were manually annotated by cortical layers, meninges or white matter using H&amp;E staining (Fig. 1d). No significant differences were found in ST spot or feature counts per region (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). Cortical layer I of iAD samples showed lower mitochondrial gene expression (Extended Data Fig. 1d), suggesting altered mitochondrial metabolism. Annotations were validated by plotting the expression of meningeal, white matter and layer-specific gray matter genes (Extended Data Fig. 1e).\n\nWe used a pseudobulk method (DESeq2) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) per region. Deeper cortical layers showed the most DEGs in nAD versus NND controls, while superficial layers were mostly affected in iAD versus nAD controls (Fig. 1e). Cortical layer III exhibited many DEGs in both iAD versus nAD and nAD versus NND comparisons. This high level of transcriptomic dysregulation led us to further examine this cortical layer. Nearly all cortical layer III DEGs were unique to iAD or nAD compared to their controls, with only 7.1% shared (Fig. 1f). These results indicate transcriptomic alterations in superficial layers of the actively immunized AD cortex.\n\nNotably, the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 ( TREM2 )  and apolipoprotein E ( APOE )  were among the genes",

Both genes are established AD risk factors 19-22 and are associated with the microglial response to Aβ 23-26 .  Additional upregulated cortical layer III genes in iAD versus nAD included alpha-2-macroglobulin ( A2M ) and caveolae-associated protein 1 ( CAVIN1 ), involved in inflammation and lysosomal function. Downregulated genes in iAD versus nAD included those encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs), such as heat shock protein family A ( Hsp70 ) member 1A ( HSPA1A ) and heat shock protein family H ( Hsp110 ) member 1 ( HSPH1 ; Fig. 1g,h). HSPs, involved in protein folding 27 and cellular stress 27,28 , were increased in nAD compared to NND controls (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 1f). Examination of the most divergent DEGs between iAD versus nAD and nAD versus NND showed that HSP genes were downregulated after immunization but showed the opposite direction in nAD compared to NND (Extended Data Fig. 1g). Conversely, synaptic plasticity-associated genes, such as semaphorin 3G ( SEMA3G ) and Hes family BHLH transcription factor 5 ( HES5 ) were upregulated in iAD brains. These findings show transcriptomic alterations in cortical layer III after immunization, including decreased protein folding and stress genes and increased microglial response genes like APOE and TREM2 .\n\nWe previously demonstrated Aβ clearance in a subset of AN1792 patients 3-5,16 . To investigate mechanisms driving varying degrees of Aβ clearance in AN1792 patients, we quantified Aβ pathology on sequential slides of ST tissue using immunohistochemistry (IHC; Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig. 1h). Aβ clearance was most prominent in the superficial cortical layers (Extended Data Fig. 1i), consistent with our previous findings 4 . The iAD cohort was categorized into those with limited (iAD-lim, N = 6) and extensive (iAD-ext, N = 7) Aβ clearance based on amounts of residual Aβ coverage (Fig. 1j,k). Phosphorylated tau (pTau) was quantified using AT8 load in gray matter across these groups, revealing no significant differences (Extended Data Fig. 1j,k). This dovetails with our prior results showing tau pathology persisted in Aβ-cleared cortical areas 16 .\n\nTo capture transcriptomic alterations around Aβ deposits, we overlaid Aβ IHC images from consecutive slides (5-10 μm apart) with ST data and extended the Aβ signal by 100 μm with decreasing intensity every 20 μm (Fig. 1l). This enabled direct examination of the Aβ niche and associated genes. Vascular Aβ-rich ST spots were excluded from analyses. Differential expression analysis of Aβ-rich ST spots in gray matter using model-based analysis of single-cell transcriptomics (MAST) 29 revealed increased expression of APOE and myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate ( MARCKS ; Fig. 1m) in iAD Aβ niches.

Pathway analyses revealed enrichment of interferon alpha response and interleukin-2 (IL-2)-STAT5 signaling in the iAD-lim Aβ niche (Extended Data Fig. 1l). Collectively, genes altered in Aβ-rich ST spots show an inflammatory signature within the Aβ niche of iAD-lim versus iAD-ext.\n\nWe visualized nonlinear relationships between gene expression and Aβ density in Aβ-rich ST spots (200-μm radius) using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS; Extended Data Fig. 1m,n). Hierarchical clustering delineated distinct expression patterns with increasing Aβ density within the iAD group (Fig. 1o). Pathway analysis of gene clusters revealed that cluster 4, peaking in Aβ-rich ST spots, was enriched for immune-related pathways, including complement signaling, inflammatory response and IL-2-STAT5 signaling (Fig. 1p). Cluster 4 genes showed the highest upregulation in iAD-lim Aβ niches, a lesser increase in iAD-ext and no upregulation in nAD (Fig. 1q). This cluster contained many immune-associated genes, including A2M , APOE , complement C3 ( C3 ), member RAS oncogene family ( RAB13 ) and secreted phosphoprotein 1 ( SPP1 ; Fig. 1r). Together, these findings reveal sustained inflammation at the Aβ niche in AN1792-immunized brains with limited Aβ clearance, marked by IL-2-STAT5 and complement signaling, and upregulation of inflammatory response genes in AD.",

Top divergent DEGs between iAD versus nAD and nAD versus NND (for example, DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member A1 ( DNAJA1 ) and Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2 ( FAIM2 )) indicated reduced cellular stress and disrupted apoptosis after AN1792 (Fig. 2f).\n\nDifferential expression analysis of microglia-enriched ST spots revealed more DEGs in iAD-ext than in iAD-lim compared to nAD, indicating a more distinct microglial state with extensive Aβ clearance (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 2f,g). Unique iAD-ext upregulated genes included APOE , MARCKS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 ( FGFR3 ; Fig. 2h). FGFR3 serves as a receptor for fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), which neurons release in response to oligomeric Aβ-induced damage. This interaction promotes microglial migration and debris phagocytosis, aiding in neuroprotection 35 . In iAD-lim, we found upregulation of previously mentioned TREM2 , A2M and LAMP1 , as well as transmembrane immune signaling adaptor TYROBP ( TYROBP ), which links TREM2 to APOE transcription in microglia 36 . Shared upregulated genes included PYCARD and Toll-like receptor 7 ( TLR7 ; Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 2f,g), while non-shared genes showed similar trends without significance in both groups (Fig. 2i). PYCARD activates the inflammasome, forming apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) specks that can cross-seed Aβ pathology 37 . Localization of proteins TMS1/ASC (encoded by PYCARD ), A2M and APOE was confirmed in IBA1 + microglia around Aβ plaques in the AN1792-immunized FCX (Fig. 2j-l).\n\nMost divergent genes in microglia-enriched ST spots between Aβ clearance groups were leukocyte-specific protein 1 ( LSP1 ) and GTPase of immunity-associated protein ( GIMAP ) genes in iAD-lim and FGFR3 and HSPA1A in iAD-ext (Extended Data Fig. 2h). LSP1 localizes to nascent phagocytic cups during Fcγ-receptor-mediated phagocytosis 38 . Pathway analysis revealed increased IL-2-STAT5 signaling in both groups, with iAD-ext uniquely upregulating oxidative phosphorylation and adipogenesis, while iAD-lim showed downregulation of complement and unfolded protein response pathways (Fig. 2m).\n\nWe next examined genes shared between iAD-ext versus nAD and NND versus nAD in microglia-enriched regions to determine if transcriptomic changes in iAD-ext brains reflect a return to homeostasis similar to NND.

Using manual annotation and machine learning, we differentiated cortical and vascular Aβ pathology (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Gray matter Aβ quantification showed reduced cortical Aβ in the TCX and PCX of the lecanemab case compared to controls (Fig. 3e). Moreover, a higher fraction of cortical Aβ (~44%) was covered by IBA1 + cells in the lecanemab case versus ~15% in controls (Fig. 3f). These data indicate regional variability in Aβ clearance by myeloid cells.\n\nTo further explore immune responses to Aβ following passive immunization, we performed scRNA-seq on cells isolated from each brain region, and used SoupX 42 to minimize ambient RNA contamination (Extended Data Fig. 3b). We assessed quality-control metrics (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d), integrated cells from all tissues (Extended Data Fig. 3e) and annotated cell clusters using their highly expressed genes (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 3f). The lecanemab case showed a relative increase in GABAergic interneurons and a decrease in endothelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 3g). T cells were enriched in all regions except HIPP, monocytes/macrophages in PCX and TCX, and microglia in TCX, PCX and HIPP (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 3g).\n\nDifferential expression analysis of microglia and macrophages revealed upregulated genes linked to microglial activation ( SPP1 and chitinase 3 like 1 ( CHI3L1 )), lysosomal function (cathepsin B ( CTSB ), granulin ( GRN )), and interferon response (interferon alpha inducible protein 6 ( IFI6 ) in the lecanemab case (Fig. 3i). Additional upregulated genes included those linked to iron storage (ferritin heavy chain 1 ( FTH1 ), ferritin light chain ( FTL )) and lipid metabolism ( APOC1 ; Fig. 3i). SPP1 and APOC1 were the most upregulated genes unique to microglia (Fig. 3j). SPP1 is expressed by activated-response microglia 43 and contributes to tissue repair 44 . We confirmed expression of SPP1 and APOC1 proteins in plaque-associated microglia within the HIPP following lecanemab treatment (Extended Data Fig. 3h,i).

Both cell types exhibited decreased HSP gene expression, while heme oxygenase 1 ( HMOX1 ), the most upregulated gene shared between them, reflected an immune response to hemorrhages in the lecanemab case.\n\nTo study microglia and macrophage functions after immunization, we performed enrichment analysis. Pathways regulating vascular functions such as apical junctions, coagulation and angiogenesis were upregulated in macrophages and microglia in the lecanemab case\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(Fig. 3k). Additionally, we found dysregulated complement signaling in macrophages and increased complement signaling in microglia (Fig. 3k). We also observed dysregulated IL-2-STAT5 signaling in microglia, with both downregulated and upregulated DEGs associated with this pathway (Fig. 3k). These data highlight distinct alterations to the brain myeloid compartment following passive Aβ immunization.\n\nNotably, microglial transcriptomic signatures in the lecanemab case varied by brain region (Extended Data Fig. 3j). Most changes in microglial gene expression were observed in the TCX and PCX, the two regions with the most Aβ clearance. Microglia from these regions exhibited increased expression of genes involved in complement signaling ( C3 ), lysosomal function and protein degradation (for example, cathepsin genes), iron storage and regulation ( FTH1 , FTL ) and SPP1 (Extended Data Fig. 3j). Regional DEGs were associated with various signaling pathways. In the FCX, DEGs indicated increased reactive oxygen species signaling (Fig. 3l). The TCX and PCX showed increased complement signaling, while the PCX also exhibited decreased interferon responses, among other changes (Fig. 3l). The HIPP demonstrated decreased cholesterol homeostasis (Fig. 3l). Additionally, microglial DEGs were linked to vascular pathways (for example, angiogenesis and coagulation), but this association was present only in the TCX and PCX, areas with extensive Aβ clearance (Fig. 3l). Thus, distinct microglial phenotypes may underlie the variability in Aβ clearance between brain regions of the lecanemab case.\n\nMicroglial states 41 were also altered, with reduced inflammatory MG8 microglia and increased ribosomal biogenesis MG3 microglia across brain regions in the lecanemab case (Extended Data Fig. 3k). In the FCX, where IBA1-Aβ recruitment was low, reductions were seen in inflammatory (MG2, MG8, MG10), phagocytic (MG5), stress-signature (MG6) and glycolytic (MG7) microglia. Conversely, inflammatory MG10 microglia increased in the PCX where IBA1-Aβ recruitment and Aβ clearance were high. Separate microglial classifications 34 showed a similar pattern with several microglial states downregulated in the FCX, that were upregulated in the TCX, PCX and HIPP regions (Extended Data Fig. 3l). These findings reveal a reduction in inflammatory MG8 microglia and an increase in ribosome biogenesis and DAM-expressing MG3 microglia across all brain regions after lecanemab immunization, similar to AN1792. Notably, the FCX displayed a distinct microglial profile compared to other brain regions.\n\nImmune cell sub-clustering identified two microglial states, Mg-2 and Mg-4, that were enriched in lecanemab-treated brain regions with",

        "title": "Spatial proteogenomics links the Aβ niche to microglial states",
        "content": "Having established microglial responses to lecanemab using single-cell analysis, we next used spatial proteogenomics on adjacent tissue sections to investigate the immune response at the Aβ niche (Fig. 4a). An 11 × 11-mm ST capture area (14,336 spots) was analyzed, with ST spots annotated using DAPI staining to delineate meninges, cortical layers and white matter, and to exclude hemorrhagic regions (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 4a). Quality-control metrics revealed variability in the number of expressed genes across nAD brains (Extended Data Fig. 4b) and in mitochondrial read percentages (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Yet, regional comparisons showed no significant differences between the nAD group and the lecanemab case. We distinguished cortical and vascular Aβ, constructed expanded Aβ niches and defined Aβ-rich ST spots (Fig. 4c). Consistent with AN1792, we found reduced cortical Aβ in the superficial layers (I and II; Extended Data Fig. 4d). However, unlike AN1792, differential expression analysis revealed the most DEGs in the deeper cortical layers (III, IV and V/VI; Fig. 4d).\n\nTranscriptomic analysis of cortical Aβ-positive ST spots showed that residual Aβ-rich ST spots in regions with the most clearance (TCX and PCX) were the most dysregulated (Extended Data Fig. 4e). In line with the single-cell analysis of microglia in Fig. 3, Aβ-rich ST spots in the TCX exhibited higher expression of genes related to complement signaling ( C3 , complement C1q C chain ( C1QC )) and lipid metabolism ( APOE , lipase A, lysosomal acid type ( LIPA )); Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 4f).

Additionally, Aβ niches in all regions except the FCX shared upregulated genes involved in lysosomal function and protein degradation ( CTSB ), iron storage ( FTH1 , FTL ) and extracellular matrix remodeling during inflammation ( CHI3L1 ). A2M was upregulated in TCX and HIPP Aβ niches. We also observed A2M localized to IBA1 + myeloid cells around\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAβ deposits (Extended Data Fig. 4h). Notably, we found upregulation of SPP1 and FTH1 across Aβ niches in all brain regions. Pathway analysis of Aβ-rich ST spots in the TCX revealed upregulation of complement signaling pathways (Fig. 4f). Intriguingly, adipogenesis pathways increased across all regions, suggesting involvement in lipid metabolism processes (Fig. 4f).\n\nWe next evaluated immune responses at the protein level within cortical Aβ niches. We adapted our ST method to include 31 barcoded antibodies targeting immune proteins, which were transferred with RNA probes to generate spatial proteogenomics data. We assessed differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) with or without corresponding DEG transcripts (Fig. 4g). Among DEPs, HLA class II histocompatibility antigen, DR alpha chain (HLA-DRA) was upregulated in Aβ-rich ST spots across all brain regions (Fig. 4g). Proteins linked to the microglial phagocytic response, such as CD11c and CD68, were upregulated in the TCX and HIPP. IHC revealed numerous CD68 + lysosomal structures within IBA1 + microglia surrounding Aβ deposits in the HIPP (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 4i). Interestingly, the immune-inhibitory receptor ligand programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) was reduced in regions with the highest Aβ clearance (TCX, PCX).\n\nWe used LOESS to assess nonlinear expression changes within Aβ-rich ST spots in the lecanemab-treated brain (Extended Data Fig. 4j,k). We identified 11 clusters (Extended Data Fig. 4l), with cluster 3 being most associated with immune pathways, including high complement and IL-2-STAT5 signaling (Extended Data Fig. 4m). Cluster 3 was notably upregulated in ST spots with the highest Aβ content in the lecanemab case, and included previously identified genes such as A2M , APOE , APOC1 , CTSB , CD68 , FCGBP , ITGAX , SPP1 and TREM2 (Fig. 4i,j and Extended Data Fig. 4n). In summary, proteogenomic analysis of the Aβ niche identified microglial states linked to Aβ clearance in a patient with AD who was treated with lecanemab.",

        "title": "Shared microglial response drives Aβ clearance after immunization",
        "content": "To identify common and distinct microglial responses to Aβ after active and passive immunization, we integrated analyses of all tissues. We quantified Aβ coverage in the gray matter, confirming a decrease in coverage associated with immunization (Fig. 5a, b). Additionally, we observed increased myeloid recruitment to Aβ (Fig. 5c). To examine cellular responses to Aβ, we integrated and clustered cortical gray matter Aβ-rich ST spots (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). This yielded nine distinct Aβ niche clusters based on gene expression (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 5c). We hypothesized that these differences were driven by distinct cellular microenvironments and tested this by using C2L to predict cell-type abundances from our integrated scRNA-seq atlas (Extended Data Fig. 5d). The cortical Aβ-6 cluster, enriched in microglia, was most prominent in the lecanemab sample, followed by a lesser increase in AN1792 samples (Fig. 5f). This cluster was defined by expression of A2M , APOE , C1QC , C3 , SPP1 and others (Extended Data Fig. 5e). Thus, the cortical Aβ-6 cluster likely represents Aβ-rich ST spots with recruited myeloid cells. In AN1792 samples with limited Aβ clearance and in lecanemab-treated brain regions, this cluster showed higher microglia abundance of Mg-2 and Mg-4 compared to nAD controls (Extended Data Fig. 5f).\n\nDifferential expression analysis of Aβ-6 ST spots between AN1792 and nAD samples identified upregulation of FAM107A , RAB13 , TREM2 and others in AN1792 samples (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 5g). In lecanemab-treated ST spots, we observed upregulation of A2M , APOE and others (Fig. 5h and Extended Data Fig. 5g). SPP1 lacked zero counts, making the MAST hurdle model unsuitable. Using DESeq2, we revealed that SPP1 was highly upregulated in lecanemab-treated cortical Aβ-6 ST spots (Fig. 5i). We plotted previously identified microglial subtypes in Aβ-rich ST spots, finding enrichment of Mg-2 and Mg-4 microglia subtypes in Aβ niches of lecanemab-treated brain areas (Fig. 5j,k and Extended Data Fig. 5h). Gene expression analysis of Aβ-associated Mg-2\n\nand Mg-4 ST spots showed increased APOE and FAM107A in AN1792 samples (Fig. 5l) and upregulated APOE , LIPA , SPP1 and TREM2 among lysosomal function and iron metabolism genes in lecanemab-treated regions (Fig. 5m). Pseudobulked fold changes showed that FAM107A is uniquely increased in Mg-2 and Mg-4 Aβ-associated ST spots in AN1792 samples, while SPP1 and LIPA are associated only with lecanemab treatment (Extended Data Fig. 5i). Notably, APOE and TREM2 increased after both treatments (Extended Data Fig. 5i). Using CellChat 45 , we mapped cell-to-cell signaling related to APOE, complement and SPP1 pathways, identifying increased microglial signaling via complement and SPP1 pathways in the lecanemab-treated brain, and elevated APOE signaling in both lecanemab and AN1792 samples (Extended Data Fig. 5j).\n\nTo achieve single-cell resolution, we applied high-definition ST to the HIPP of the lecanemab-treated brain and nAD controls (Extended Data Fig. 5k). Nuclei were segmented 46 , clustered and annotated by top markers (Fig. 5n and Extended Data Fig. 5k,o). We mapped nuclei to Aβ plaques using immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 5o). Myeloid cells, putative microglia, were overrepresented within 20 μm of Aβ plaques in the lecanemab-treated brain but not in nAD controls (Fig. 5o,p). Differential expression analysis confirmed increased expression of SPP1 , APOE and others in microglia near Aβ plaques after lecanemab treatment (Fig. 5q). SPP1 expression was localized to nuclei around Aβ (Fig. 5r). These data validate many of the lower-resolution ST findings throughout the study.\n\nFinally, to identify common and distinct gene expression changes in microglia and at the Aβ plaque niche from AN1792-treated (Figs. 1m, 2e and 5g,l) and lecanemab-treated (Extended Data Fig. 4f and Figs. 3i and 5h,m) brains, we ranked genes by probabilistic fold change (PFC) and assigned percentile ranks. In AN1792 samples, FAM107A was the top response gene, followed by ATP synthase inhibitory factor subunit 1 ( ATP5IF1 ), TREM2 and APOE (Fig. 5s and Extended Data Fig. 5p). In lecanemab-treated brain areas, CHI3L1 , F3 , HMOX1 and SPP1 were the top induced genes (Fig. 5t and Extended Data Fig. 5q). Notably, TREM2 and APOE emerged as common responsive genes in both treatments (Fig. 5u). Our analysis highlights both distinct ( FAM107A , SPP1 ) and common ( APOE , TREM2 ) microglial response genes related to active and passive Aβ immunization.\n\nWe correlated TREM2 and APOE expression with clinical data for AN1792 patients, finding a positive correlation between AN1792 antibody titer and TREM2 / APOE expression in microglia-enriched ST spots (Fig. 5v). There was also a trend toward a negative correlation between APOE expression and Aβ plaque score assessed throughout the neocortex using a standardized method 16 . This shows that the expression levels of microglial APOE and TREM2 were directly associated with the immunization response and Aβ clearance. Altogether, our findings delineate the microglial response mediating Aβ clearance in AD brains immunized against Aβ.",

        "content": "This study defines the microglial response to Aβ immunization in patients with AD. We detected upregulation of APOE and TREM2 in microglia of both actively and passively immunized brains. Notably, side effects from passive immunization are more common in APOE ε4 carriers 9,14,47 , and antibodies targeting TREM2 have been explored as therapeutic strategies for AD 48,49 . Our findings indicate that APOE and TREM2 play crucial roles in microglial responses to Aβ immunization, suggesting the microglial response influences both efficacy and risk of adverse effects.\n\nWe observed a decrease in the expression of genes related to protein folding and cellular stress in microglia of iAD brains, indicating a more favorable cerebral environment after immunization. Further, we observed elevated expression of neuroprotective genes, including FGFR3 , in microglia-enriched ST spots of extensively cleared brains. FGFR3-FGF2 signaling may facilitate beneficial neuronal-microglial communication and support neuronal health in cleared Aβ regions.\n\nOur data also indicate a metabolic shift in microglia during Aβ immunization. In brains with extensive Aβ clearance, we found increased oxidative phosphorylation and reduced glycolysis in microglia. This suggests that active immunization can mitigate chronic neuroinflammation in AD and reestablish homeostasis in brains with extensive Aβ clearance.\n\nTo examine passive immunization, we studied a patient with APOE ε4 homozygous AD who was treated with lecanemab. Our scRNA-seq analysis revealed increased presence of two microglial subtypes in regions with the highest Aβ clearance. Both subtypes spatially associated with Aβ plaques and expressed DAM markers (for example, APOE and TREM2 ) and showed elevated complement signaling. Yet, these subtypes differed in their expression of homeostatic markers, as well as their expression of AXL , C3 and CD74 . Complement signaling, particularly C3, plays a role in Aβ clearance by aiding Aβ recognition and phagocytosis by microglia 50 .\n\nComparative analysis of active and passive immunization revealed that residual Aβ niches and microglia in the lecanemab brain uniquely upregulated CHI3L1 and SPP1 signaling, while AN1792 treatment upregulated FAM107A and ATP5IF1 . Lecanemab-treated brain areas also showed increased expression of lysosomal and protein degradation genes. Both treatments increased APOE and TREM2 expression and reduced HSP-coding genes and stress-responsive microglial states.\n\nImportantly, we found that APOE and TREM2 expression in microglia-enriched ST spots correlated positively with anti-AN1792 antibody titer and trended toward a negative correlation with Aβ plaque load. This suggests that a more robust and sustained immune response to vaccination is linked to long-term microglial APOE and TREM2 expression and enhanced Aβ clearance. These findings support the hypothesis that microglial APOE and TREM2 are instrumental in sustained Aβ clearance following immunization.\n\nFew studies have reported postmortem cases of lecanemab-treated patients 18,51 . Our study includes one rare case with multifocal intracerebral hemorrhage. Therefore, future studies with larger sample sizes and longitudinal designs are needed to validate and extend our findings related to passive immunization. Animal models can further dissect the mechanistic role of our key microglial markers in Aβ clearance. Additionally, the effects of APOE genotype and sex on immune responses to Aβ immunization warrant further investigation. Despite the limited sample size, our analysis of rare human samples provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms driving Aβ clearance and suggest potential targets for enhancing immunotherapy efficacy.\n\nIn summary, we reveal distinct microglial phenotypes linked to Aβ immunization in the AD brain. These findings provide new insights into the microglial mechanisms underlying Aβ clearance and lay the foundation for refining next-generation immunotherapies in AD.",

        "content": "AN1792 study cohort . Clinical and neuropathologic follow-up of patients with AD enrolled in the Elan Pharmaceuticals phase I trial of AN1792 was previously reported 3,10-12 . FCX tissue was available from 22 patients with iAD, of whom 16 had a neuropathologic diagnosis of AD. The remaining 6 patients had a different cause of dementia and were excluded from further analysis. Notably, 3 of the 16 AD brains (cases 2, 3 and 9) were omitted due to low RNA quality scores, leaving a final cohort of 13 iAD samples. One patient (case 1) required imaging in life, which demonstrated features of meningoencephalitis 10 and neuroradiological features consistent with the later-defined amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) edema 16 . With inadequate numbers of postmortem placebo-treated samples from the original AN1792 trial, frontal cortices of 6 nAD cases and 6 NND cases were used as controls. Cases were matched as closely as possible for age at death. In total, postmortem FFPE frontal cortical samples of 13 iAD (mean age of death, 79.97 years; range, 63-89 years), 6 nAD controls (mean age of death, 79.60 years; range, 65-89 years) and 6 NND controls (mean age of death, 74.93 years; range, 63-82) were included in the active immunization analysis. All nAD cases and 4 NND FCX samples were sourced from Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Two additional NND samples were sourced from Northwestern Pathology. Relevant clinical and demographic information of iAD, nAD and NND cases are listed in Extended Data Table 1. Tissue blocks were cut into 5-μm sections and stored at 4 °C until further use.\n\nLecanemab and nAD controls . Clinical and neuropathologic findings of a 65-year-old APOE ε4/ε4 female patient with early cognitive decline treated with lecanemab were previously reported 17,18 . In the open-label phase, the patient received three intravenous lecanemab infusionseach 2 weeks apart. Four days after the final dose, the patient developed stroke-like symptoms, received tissue plasminogen activator and suffered fatal intracerebral hemorrhages. Consent was obtained to perform full-body postmortem examination and subsequent reporting of the neuropathologic findings related to her receiving anti-Aβ. Multiple foci of histiocytic/microglial reaction to parenchymal amyloid plaques were noted. According to NIA-AA 2012 consensus guidelines 52 , the AD neuropathologic changes would be categorized as 'high'. FFPE tissue blocks from the FCX, TCX, PCX and HIPP of both donors were sectioned into 5-μm slices and stored at 4 °C. The nAD control samples (mean age at death, 69.3 years; range, 62-82 years) were matched for parenchymal AD pathology (high), vascular AD pathology and APOE ε4/ε4 genotype. Notably, one nAD donor also had magnetic resonance imaging-positive microbleeds on gradient echo sequences. Relevant clinical and demographic information of lecanemab and nAD cases are listed in Extended Data Table 2.",

DNA was isolated from all nAD and NND samples, as well as AN1792 samples 102-19 and 102-20, which lacked APOE genotype information. Positive controls were included to validate genotyping. Quality and concentration of extracted DNA were assessed to ensure suitability for genotyping. APOE genotyping for the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs429358 and rs7412 was conducted at the University of Illinois at Chicago Genomics Research Core using the BioMark HD Real-Time PCR system (Fluidigm) and SNP Type assays (rs429358: C\\_\\_\\_3084793\\_20; rs7412: C\\_\\_\\_\\_904973\\_10; Thermo Fisher). Genotyping was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol, with each SNP assayed using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays (Applied Biosystems). Genotype calling was conducted with the SNP Genotyping Analysis software (Fluidigm) using default analysis parameters: a confidence threshold of 65, global normalization and k -means clustering. PCR cycle 35 was used for SNP calling, and each sample was analyzed in three technical replicates. No template controls were incorporated into vacant inlets as negative controls. Allele calls were determined based on fluorescence signals from FAM and VIC probes, and each APOE haplotype was assigned by combining the alleles of rs429358 and rs7412, resulting in the following classifications: ε2 (T/T), ε3 (T/C) and ε4 (C/C).",

After deparaffinization and dissociation by pestle, single cells were hybridized with barcoded probes overnight. GEM generation and library construction were performed as outlined in the Chromium Fixed RNA Profiling Reagent Kits for Multiplexed Samples manual (CG000527; rev. E; 10x Genomics). The first batch included four brain regions-FCX, TCX, PCX and HIPP-from one nAD control (NMA22300) and one lecanemab-treated sample (NMA22-205). The second batch contained the same regions from two additional nAD controls (A14-193 and A11-170). The third batch contained FCX samples from ten AN1792 samples (102-1, 102-7, 102-8, 102-11, 102-15, 102-16, 102-17, 102-19, 102-21 and 102-22).

Limited cell numbers in samples 102-7, 102-8, 102-11 and 102-21 restricted them to a single barcode each. We targeted approximately 8,000 cells per barcode, aiming for a total of 16,000 cells per tissue per pool. For batches one and three, two pools were generated, targeting 32,000 cells across both pools for samples with dual barcodes.

        "content": "images . Tissue imaging was performed with a TissueGnostics slide scanner. The acquired images were processed using Fiji software (National Institutes of Health (NIH)). Briefly, deconvolution was applied to the images for the hematoxylin and DAB staining. Manual thresholds were set for Aβ reactivity using the DAB stain by a researcher blinded to sample identification. The derived binary signal was further cleaned by removing small particles. Aβ coverage in the gray matter was determined by calculating the ratio of Aβ deposits in the gray matter to the total area of the gray matter per sample. To construct the expanded Aβ niches, the binary Aβ signal was artificially extended by 100 μm from its original boundary, with a gradual decrease in signal intensity noted every 20 μm. Subsequently, the images were aligned to the CytAssist image using the Loupe browser (version 7.0.1, 10x Genomics) and further integrated with the spatial RNA data using Space Ranger version 2.1.1. Importantly, ST spots with unreliable Aβ staining, arising from technical issues or tissue anomalies such as folds or holes, were\n\nomitted from subsequent Aβ niche analyses. Additionally, vascular Aβ ST spots were excluded from any further analyses.\n\nImaging and processing of phosphorylated Tau (AT8) DAB stains . Tissue imaging for AT8-stained slides was performed at ×20 magnification using an automated slide scanner microscope (Olympus VS110, Olympus America) at the Biomedical Imaging Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton. The acquired images were processed using Fiji software (NIH). Briefly, deconvolution was applied to separate the hematoxylin and DAB signals. Manual thresholds were set for AT8 reactivity in the DAB channel by a researcher blinded to sample identification. The resulting binary signal was refined by removing small particles. AT8 coverage in the gray matter was quantified as the ratio of AT8-positive area to the total gray matter area per sample.\n\nProcessing of immunofluorescence images for spatial proteogenomics . High-resolution imaging in the spatial proteogenomic workflow was conducted using Fiji. The DAPI channel was auto-thresholded using the Li vector, with subsequent removal of entities larger than ~1 cm and application of the watershed function to separate binary nuclear masks. The IBA1 channel processing involved dividing the image into a 25 × 25 grid, applying Bleach Correction via Histogram Matching to each segment, reassembling the image and using the RollingBall algorithm (radius, 2.8 μm) to reduce background noise. Both IBA1 and Aβ channels underwent manual thresholding, conducted by a researcher blinded to sample identification. After binarization, channels were subjected to two rounds of dilation and erosion, followed by a filtering step to remove oversized objects in Aβ and IBA1, targeting noise reduction. The binarized IBA1 masks were then utilized to refine the bleach-corrected IBA1 channel. This refinement was achieved by overlaying the binarized IBA1 mask onto the bleach-corrected IBA1 channel. In this process, only the regions within the confines of the binarized mask were retained, while areas outside the mask were cleared.\n\nVascular and cortical Aβ were identified in the high-resolution images from the spatial proteogenomic workflow using the LabKit machine learning tool 54 within Fiji. Each sample was analyzed with a unique classifier to generate a vascular Aβ probability map. This map was initially enhanced with despeckling and Gaussian blur ( σ = 4) to improve smoothness, followed by triple dilation and erosion and filtering to exclude small particles. The probability maps were then manually thresholded by a researcher blinded to sample identification. Observations of vascular Aβ missed by the automated process but detected upon visual inspection were carefully annotated and included. The vascular Aβ binary signal was dilated twice before being extracted from the processed Aβ channel, leaving the residual signal to be identified as cortical Aβ. Expanded Aβ niches were subsequently delineated as described above. For nAD controls A14-193 and A11-170, vascular Aβ was manually annotated instead of using LabKit. Importantly, ST spots exhibiting unreliable Aβ staining, whether due to technical complications or the presence of tissue folds or holes, were excluded from further analyses related to the Aβ niche.\n\nAβ coverage and IBA1 colocalization . The coverage of cortical or total Aβ within the gray matter was determined by calculating the percentage of the area covered by the binarized cortical or total Aβ mask in the gray matter to the total area of the gray matter for each brain region per donor. To evaluate the association between IBA1 + cells and cortical or total Aβ, the area where cortical Aβ and IBA1 colocalized was divided by the total area of cortical or total Aβ present in the gray matter.",

        "content": "To identify DEGs across various regions of interest within our datasets, we used two distinct differential expression techniques: DESeq2 (ref. 56) and MAST 29 . Each approach was adapted to suit the specific characteristics and requirements of the comparison, considering the nature of the data (pseudobulk for DESeq2 and single-cell method for MAST) and the level at which covariates were standardized (sample level for DESeq2 and ST spot or cell level for MAST). Covariate selection was guided by variance partition analysis, which identified gDNA as the primary driver of variance after the experimental group. Additionally, we accounted for the number of genes expressed in a subset of ST spots or cells to control for differences in quality and sequencing depth. Sex and age were included due to their known effects on immune responses in AD. Additionally, manually annotated regions or cortical layer annotations per ST spot were incorporated where applicable to address sampling variability across anatomical areas.\n\nDESeq2 . DESeq2 was initiated by subsetting the data for ST spots within the region of interest (ROI). Continuous covariates at the sample level, including age, average nFeatures within subsampled ST spots and gDNA percentage, were standardized within each ROI. We then filtered out genes not expressed in at least 1% of either comparison group based on raw counts, excluding genes starting with RPS, RPL, MT or HB. Pseudobulk data were created by summing raw counts by\n\ndonor to facilitate a more robust differential expression analysis. The DESeq2 analysis was conducted with the inclusion of covariates such as sex, age, average features within subsampled ST spots and gDNA percentage, all of which were standardized, if continuous. The DESeq function was run with fitType = 'local' to estimate dispersions using local regression, the results function was run with independentFiltering = FALSE to include low-expression genes in statistical testing, and LFC shrinkage was performed by running lfcShrink with type = 'apeglm'. P values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. DEG significance thresholds were set at an adjusted P value of 0.05 and a log2 fold change of ±log 2 (1.5).\n\nMAST . For MAST, data were subsetted to include only the ST spots or cells of interest. Sample-specific and brain region-specific downsampling was applied to ensure that no single sample contributed more than 50% of ST spots or cells within a comparison group, that the fold difference in total ST spots or cells between comparison groups did not exceed three, and that each group contained no more than 3,000 ST spots or cells. Continuous covariates at the ST spot level, including age, the CDR from recorrected SCT data and gDNA percentage per sample, were standardized within each subset of ST spots or cells. We applied PrepSCTFindMarkers on the ROI, which recorrects SCTransform counts to normalize sequencing depth across samples. SCT data (log1p-transformed SCT counts) were then extracted from the Seurat object. Genes prefixed with RPS, RPL, MT or HB were excluded, and additional filtering was performed based on percentage expression within comparison groups. Genes were tested if they were expressed in 1% of both groups and in 10% of either group using SCT expression data, except for Visium HD data, where genes were tested if they were expressed in 1% of either group. The log 2 fold change between comparison groups for the remaining genes was calculated using the Seurat FoldChange function. MAST was run with covariates such as sex, age, CDR, gDNA percentage, brain region and manually annotated regions or cortical layers, all of which were standardized if continuous. Sample ID, or brain region and sample ID, was included as a random effect for comparisons involving multiple samples. MAST hurdle P values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. LFC from the prior calculation was appended to the results, with significance thresholds for differential expression set at an adjusted P value of 0.05 and a LFC of ±log 2 (1.5).",

        "content": "Humans have developed a sophisticated immune system that is able to rapidly detect and respond to pathogenic organisms or tissue damage. This  system  has  two  branches,  the  innate  and  the  adaptive  immune system. The adaptive immune system consists of B and T cells, which express a huge variety of highly specific receptors that detect a unique antigen. This system is initially slower to respond than the innate immune system. During an infection for example, it can take a number of days  for  the  adaptive  immune  response  to  take  effect  (Kumar  et  al., 2018). However, an immunological memory is created after the first response to the pathogen, thus on re-challenge the response is more rapid.\n\nThe innate immune system consists of cells such as macrophages, neutrophils and  microglia  that  contain  germline-encoded  pattern recognition  receptors  (PRRs).  PRRs  detect  set  sequences  denoting pathogenor danger-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs), which contain either foreign or host-derived activating motifs respectively (Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002). The recognition of these molecular sequences is key for the innate immune system to mount a sufficient response. On activation, a PRR induces a signalling cascade within minutes, triggering pathway-specific transcription factors that facilitate  the  transcription  of  key  inflammatory  genes,  which  are",

To date, there  is  no  way  to  prevent  cognitive  decline  and  therapies  are  limited.  This  review  provides  a  neuroimmunological perspective on the progression of AD, and discusses the immune-targeted therapies that are in preclinical and clinical trials that may impact the development of this disease. Specifically, we look to the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome, its triggers in the brain and how its activation can contribute to the progression of dementia.  We  summarise  the  range  of  inhibitors  targeting  the  NLRP3  inflammasome  and  its  downstream pathways that are under investigation, and discuss future therapeutic perspectives for this devastating condition. This article is part of the Special Issue on \"Microglia\".\n\ntranslated and released e.g. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF α )  or  Interferonγ (IFNγ ). There are many different PRRs, including the Toll like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR) and RIG-like receptor (RLR) families, which differ in their cellular location, structure and the motif they recognise, meaning the cell is well equipped to detect any challenge or stress signal (Takeda et al., 2003; Heneka et al., 2018).\n\nThis first inflammatory response is central for the initial control of the trauma or challenge, such as invading pathogens (e.g. bacteria or viruses).  The  innate  immune  cells  also  coordinate  with  cells  of  the adaptive immune system and at later stages of the immune response, they secrete protective factors such as interleukin (IL)-10 to participate in  wound  healing  and  resolve  the  tissue  damage.  These  immune  responses are normally  beneficial.  Without  a  functioning  immune response,  humans  are  vulnerable  to  recurrent,  severe  infections  and even death.\n\nHowever, there are instances where the immune system can become maladaptive, and innate immune triggers induce an over-activated or non-resolving, chronic response. This heightened immune response is observed  across  many  diseases  such  as  atherosclerosis,  gout  and  in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer ' s  disease  (AD).  In  this review, we will discuss the role of the innate immune system in the development and progression of AD. In particular, we will focus on the role of the NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, summarising the latest findings on NLRP3\n\n* Corresponding author.

AD is broadly divided into two categories, early onset AD (EOAD) or late onset AD (LOAD). EOAD affects &lt; 1 -5% of all cases, it is typically familial and occurs before the age of 65 (Tanzi, 2012). In contrast, LOAD is much more prevalent and the greatest risk factor is age. Currently over 33% of people aged 85 and over have AD (Rajan et al., 2021), and considering our aging population it is estimated that there will be over 78 million people  with  dementia  and  AD  in  2030  (WHO  Global  status  report, 2021).

Sequence of events that lead to the development of Alzheimer ' s disease. 1. The progression of AD has a long pre-clinical phase. A β is the first protein to become deposited in the brain, which forms oligomers, protofibrils and ultimately dense insoluble plaques. 2. The A β is followed by tau hyperphosphorylation, which then loses its capacity to stabilise microtubules, and forms intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. These neurons eventually die leaving extracellular tangles, often known as ghost tangles, behind. 3. The build-up of A β and tau activates microglia and astrocytes, triggering cytokine release and neuroinflammation. 4. Over time, these factors come together to cause neuronal death, inducing structural brain changes particularly at sites such as the hippocampus and frontal cortex. The progression to dementia and severe AD is more rapid.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;0&gt;≥\n\nR.M. McManus and E. Latz common feature and is associated with the increasing cognitive decline (Fig. 1) (Mufson et al., 2008).\n\nA β is formed from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the sequential cleavage of β - and γ -secretase. To date, 102 mutations have been found in APP, with over 38 of them pathogenic (https://www.alzforum.org/ mutations). Such mutations typically favour cleavage of APP towards the amyloidogenic as opposed to non-amyloidogenic pathway (Tcw and Goate,  2017).  Strikingly,  346  mutations  have  been  documented  in PSEN1, which encodes for the protein presenilin-1 and forms the active cleavage site of γ -secretase. Of these mutations, 213 were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic (https://www.alzforum.org/mutations ).  Murine  animal  models  of  AD  are  often  based  on  these  mutations, such as the APPswe/PSEN1dE9 or the 5xFAD mice that mimic many features of AD, and are two of the more commonly used lines (Forner et al., 2021; McManus et al., 2014).\n\nThe progression of AD is initially quite slow, with a long pre-clinical phase. A β is the first protein to become deposited in the brain, which can begin  approx.  two  decades  before  the  emergence  of  cognitive  issues (Villemagne et al., 2013). The  A β is followed by tau hyperphosphorylation changes, inflammation, brain atrophy, then memory impairment  and  finally  cognitive  decline  (Fig.  1)  (Jack  et  al.,  2010; Rajmohan and Reddy, 2017). Once the structural brain changes occur, the progression to dementia and severe AD is more rapid. Hippocampal atrophy and the following memory impairment occur on average 4 and 3 years  respectively  before  the  onset  of  dementia  (Villemagne  et  al., 2013). The cognitive changes observed are divided into mild cognitive impairment (MCI), moderate and then severe AD, and range from general problems with thinking and memory to severe memory loss, personality changes and behavioural issues. Of those with MCI, 10 -20% will develop AD within a year (Koepsell and Monsell, 2012; Petersen, 2016), and 68 -80% will convert within 6 years (Mauri et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2011; Lopez, 2013).\n\nTau  is  a  neuronal  microtubule-associated  protein,  that  becomes hyperphosphorylated in AD and loses its capacity to stabilise microtubules. This results in impaired neuronal transport and further sensitises neurons  to  A β -induced  toxicity  (Rajmohan  and  Reddy,  2017;  Ittner et al., 2011). These changes occur downstream of amyloid plaque formation,  and  A β has  been  shown  to  activate  a  number  of  kinases including  CDK-5  and  GSK-3 β that  drive  tau  hyperphosphorylation (Rajmohan and Reddy, 2017).\n\nIt is important to note that while A β is a classic feature of AD, there are  older  individuals  who  have  significant  levels  of  A β deposition throughout the brain but are cognitively intact (Mormino and Papp, 2018; Zolochevska and Taglialatela, 2016). It is not fully understood why that is the case. One possibility that might distinguish these people is  in  how the resident brain cells are responding to the A β stimulus, which may be different. Another idea is that the individuals will develop memory decline at later timepoints. Indeed, not all those who receive a diagnosis of MCI go on to develop AD (Koepsell and Monsell, 2012). Uncovering the mechanisms that promote resilience in these individuals is a topic of interest and will certainly help with the development of therapies to protect the brain against cognitive decline.",

That was followed by rivastigmine in 1997 and galantamine in 2001 (which are also cholinesterase inhibitors), and the  N-methyld -aspartate  (NMDA)  receptor  antagonist  memantine  in 2003. These drugs act by either increasing the availability of acetylcholine  to  preserve  cholinergic  neuronal  signalling  or  by  blocking NMDA and thus reducing the glutamatergic neuronal hyperexcitability observed in AD. To date they are the only small molecule pharmaceutical therapies available for AD. Importantly, they are capable of managing the symptoms for a few months as opposed to slowing or even stopping disease pathology.\n\nDue to the central role of amyloid in the development and progression  of  AD,  as  a  novel  therapeutic  strategy  many  researchers  have focused their efforts on targeting this protein directly. This resulted in the first FDA approved therapy in 15 years, Aducanumab (Aduhelm ™ ) in 2021. Aducanumab is an A β -targeted monoclonal antibody that can bind A β aggregates,  including soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils (Budd Haeberlein et al., 2022).

Finally,  Donanemab  is  another  humanised  antibody  that  was submitted  to  the  FDA  for  approval  in  2023,  but  it  recognises  A β in established plaques, specifically by targeting an N-terminal pyroglutamate A β epitope (Sims et al., 2023; Mintun et al., 2021). Binding of these antibodies to A β interrupts the amyloid-aggregation process, while also targeting the A β for removal by microglia-mediated phagocytosis (Linse et al., 2020; Sevigny et al., 2016). While donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine  and  memantine  all  received  approval  from  the  European Medicines Agency (EMA) shortly after FDA approval, that is not the case for any of the A β -targeted immunotherapies. To date, Aducanumab is only available to people in the USA and Lecanumab is available in the USA  and  Japan.  There  has  been  some  controversy  regarding  the approval of these compounds, particularly Aducanumab. This is because the ENGAGE and EMERGE phase 3 clinical trials to test Aducanumab were terminated early in 2019 when an interim analysis predicted the studies  would  not  meet  their  primary  endpoints.  A  later  re-analysis showed  that  those  on  the  highest  dose  of  Aducanumab  had  slowed cognitive  decline  in  the  EMERGE,  but  not  the  ENGAGE,  trial  (Budd Haeberlein  et  al.,  2022).  Based  on  these  findings,  the  FDA  granted accelerated approval for the use of Aducanumab in 2021, although this was met with mixed reactions from the AD community. In January 2024, it  was  announced  that  Aducanumab  would  be  withdrawn  from  the market and production discontinued, likely due to the controversies and mixed results.\n\nTargeting A β directly has revolutionised the treatments available for AD, and revitalised the amyloid hypothesis, which after decades of failed clinical trials was starting to be questioned. Indeed, these therapies also provide  new  treatment  perspectives  for  those  with  Down  Syndrome, who also develop A β -containing plaques as they age (Annus et al., 2016). However, there are important considerations before undertaking these therapies. While all three A β -targeted compounds can quickly remove A β in  the  brain,  cognitive  decline  is  slowed,  rather  than  stopped completely (Budd Haeberlein et al., 2022; Sims et al., 2023; van Dyck et al., 2023). There is also the risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities  (ARIA),  which  can  be  a  brain  edema  or  microhaemorrhage (ARIA-E or ARIA-H respectively) (Salloway et al., 2022). Indeed those with certain genetic predisposition such as apolipoprotein E4 (APOE) carriers appear more vulnerable to such effects (Salloway et al., 2022). As A β -targeted immunotherapies are not suitable for everyone, alternative treatments are still needed  to prevent cognitive decline. Immune-modulating therapies  (discussed  below)  may  provide  a  new solution for how we treat MCI and AD.",

        "content": "Microglia  are  yolk-sac  derived  myeloid  cells  that  carry  out  many critical  functions  in  the  brain  from  maintaining  homeostasis,  modulating  neuronal  activity  and  importantly,  mediating  the  immune response  of  the  central  nervous  system  (CNS).  These  cells  are  the guardians  of  the  brain.  Microglia  are  highly  phagocytic  and  by expressing an array of PRRs to detect PAMPs or DAMPs, along with constantly  surveying  their  microenvironment,  they  are  poised  to respond to any threat or injury they encounter. However, unlike other tissues and organs, the brain is very sensitive to inflammation. Therefore, the microglial inflammatory response must be carefully regulated to limit the damage to neighbouring neurons and later support remodelling or repair. There are also number of receptor-ligand interactions\n\nR.M. McManus and E. Latz between microglia and astrocytes or neurons to maintain the microglia in a regulated state (Manich et al., 2019; Finneran and Nash, 2019). This is a very delicate balance, and the microglial response easily becomes disordered in diseases of the brain.\n\nWhen Alois Alzheimer first described Alzheimer ' s disease in 1907, he already  noted  the  presence  of  abnormal  glial  cells  neighbouring  the amyloid plaques (Alzheimer et al., 1995). We now know that microglia have a key role in the progression and development of AD. Genome-wide association  studies  (GWAS)  have  identified  many  microglial-specific genes that increase the risk for developing AD, such as Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), CD33 and complement receptor 1 (CR1) (Naj et al., 2011; Bellenguez et al., 2022), many of which affect microglial phagocytosis (Butler et al., 2021; Ulrich et al., 2014). In 2008, Halle and colleagues first showed that when microglia phagocytose A β it triggers activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Halle et  al.,  2008),  thus  firmly  establishing the  role of innate immune signalling in this neurodegenerative disease.",

        "title": "5. NLRP3 inflammasome activation -what we know so far",
        "content": "The first inflammasome complex to be discovered was the NLRP1 inflammasome by the group of Jürg Tschopp in 2002 (Martinon et al.,\n\n2002).  Inflammasomes  are  multi-protein  complexes  that  contain  a sensor protein (in this case NLRP1), the adaptor protein Apoptosis-associated  speck-like  protein  containing  a  caspase  recruitment domain (ASC) and the proteolytic enzyme caspase-1. This novel finding  was  quickly  followed  by  the  identification  of  the  NLRP3 inflammasome and unravelling of the complex signalling pathways that regulate  the  assembly  of  this  multi  protein  complex  (Agostini  et  al., 2004;  Martinon  et  al.,  2006;  Mariathasan  et  al.,  2006).  There  are  a number  of  PRRs  that  can  form  inflammasome  complexes,  including NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4 and AIM2 (Zheng et al., 2020). While the triggers of these PRRs are unique to each sensor protein, once activated, the complexes  converge  on  similar  signalling  pathways,  ultimately  producing  active  IL-1 β ,  as  discussed  in  more  detail  below.  The  NLRP3 inflammasome is the best studied inflammasome complex, and to date, has the most well-defined role in AD. Therefore, NLRP3 will be the focus of this review.\n\nDue to its inflammatory nature, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is a tightly regulated process with a number of steps, that need to occur in a specific order (Fig. 2). The first is a priming step, where a cytokine receptor or TLR signalling induces NFκ B activation and nuclear translocation resulting in the transcription and later translation of NLRP3  and  pro-IL-1 β (Bauernfeind  et  al.,  2009).  Post-translational\n\nFig. 2. NLRP3 inflammasome signalling pathway, activators and inhibitors. NLRP3 requires two signals for activation, a priming and licensing step (transcriptional regulation) and an activating step (post-transcriptonal regulation). TLR or cytokine receptor signalling can prime NLRP3 by increasing the mRNA levels of Nlrp3 and Il1 β . Once translated, NLRP3 is in an autoinhibited form, and a second signal is required to release this and allow full assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex. A number of post-translational modifications occur on NLRP3, such as phosphorylation, that facilitate this conformational change. NLRP3 also transitions from an oligomeric, cage like structure, into a disc-like shape, exposing its PYD domain and allowing ASC to bind. A β and tau can act as this second signal. Once assembled, ASC nucleates into a speck formation, providing a platform for the recruitment and auto-catalysis of caspase-1. Cleaved-caspase-1 in turn cleaves GSDMD, allowing GSDMD-N to oligomerize and form a pore in the plasma membrane. Pro-IL-1 β is cleaved to its active form, which can leave through the GSDMD pores, and also through GSDMD-independent means. ASC-specks are also released, which can be taken up by neighbouring cells, or act as a seed for A β ,  perpetuating the inflammatory cycle. Current therapies are highlighted in red, namely NLRP3-targeted ASOs, to induced mRNA degradation. CRID3, Oridonin or DFV890, are specific NLRP3  inflammasome  inhibitors.  VX-765,  a  caspase-1  inhibitor.  Nanobodies,  to  disrupt  ASC  specks.  Anakinra,  Canakinumab  or  Rilonacept  to  prevent  IL1 β signalling.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nR.M. McManus and E. Latz modifications (PTMs) also occur during the first step, such as dephosphorylation, that contribute to the licensing of NLRP3 for downstream signalling  (Akbal  et  al.,  2022).  NLRP3  is  initially  produced  in  an auto-inhibited and closed form, and a second signal is required to release this auto-inhibition allowing assembly of NLRP3 into an inflammasome complex.\n\nOnce  the  cell  detects  this  second  signal,  other  PTMs,  including phosphorylation and ubiquitination occur on NLRP3 (see (Akbal et al., 2022) for a thorough review) that facilitate the transition of NLRP3 from an inactive oligomer to an active multimeric inflammasome. The NLRP3 protein contains a LRR, a NACHT domain containing ATP binding and hydrolysis activity, and a pyrin (PYD) domain, with PTMs identified on all three regions (Akbal et al., 2022). The NACHT domain is critical in the  activation  of  NLRP3,  where  ATP  binds  the  NACHT  nucleotide binding domain (NBD) in the active state (Fu and Wu, 2023). In the inactive state, ADP is bound (Fu and Wu, 2023). It is important to note that  unlike  most  cell  types,  human  monocytes  do  not  require  two separate signalling steps to activate NLRP3, where engagement of TLR4 alone or presence of nigericin can drive NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Akbal et al., 2022; Gaidt et al., 2016; Gritsenko et al., 2020).\n\nRecent studies have uncovered the exact structures formed by NLRP3 and its inflammasome complex that both influence and contribute to its activation. In the inactive state, NLRP3 oligomers are closed and can form a cage-like structure, where the PYD domain is hidden (Andreeva et al., 2021; Hochheiser et al., 2022a). The oligomers are formed though LRR-interactions between two NLRP3 proteins, and then back-to-back interactions with other NLRP3-LRR regions, ultimately forming a complex of 10 (human) or 12 -16 (mouse) NLRP3 proteins in a double ring structure (Andreeva et al., 2021; Hochheiser et al., 2022a). Once activated,  the  NLRP3  complex  undergoes  a  conformational  change  and opens up to a disc-like shape (Xiao et al., 2023). The PYD domain of NLRP3 becomes accessible, allowing the PYD domain of ASC to bind. ASC then oligomerizes in a prion-like manner (Hochheiser et al., 2022b), forming a speck and growing to approx. 1 μ m in size (Fernandes-Alnemri et  al.,  2007).  Along  with  its  PYD  domain,  ASC  also  has  a  caspase recruitment domain (CARD), that binds pro-caspase-1. Facilitated by the molecular  ASC  platform,  pro-caspase-1  dimerizes  and  undergoes  an auto-catalytic reaction that produces active caspase-1 (Fig. 2). This is a crucial  step  in  the  pathway,  the  active  caspase-1  can  now  cleave pro-IL-1 β and pro-IL-18 to their active forms. Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is also cleaved by caspase-1, releasing its N-terminal fragment (He et al., 2015). This step allows GSDMD to oligomerize and form a pore in the plasma membrane, leading to the extracellular release of active IL-1 β , IL-18, ASC specks and often, pyroptotic cell death. In the absence of GSDMD, GSDME can become cleaved and form a pore in the membrane, although this does not occur as quickly as GSDMD (Zhou and Abbott, 2021). Indeed, not all NLRP3-inflammasome triggers induce GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis (Rashidi et al., 2019). Some do not induce pyroptosis at all, even though they sufficiently induce NLRP3-dependent release of active IL-1 β (Wolf et al., 2016). IL-1 β can also be released without  pyroptosis  occurring  (Monteleone  et  al.,  2018).  Cleaving pro-IL-1 β to its active form changes the charge of this protein, allowing association with the negatively charged plasma membrane ruffles and therefore unconventional release (Monteleone et al., 2018).\n\nUnlike other forms of cell death, such as apoptosis which is quite immunologically silent, pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory process and quickly alerts neighbouring cells (Man et al., 2017). These nearby cells sense the released IL-1 β ,  IL-18 and ASC, but also the contents of the original dying cell that act as DAMPs, triggering a secondary response (Bertheloot et al., 2021). IL-1 β release is highly inflammatory, and activates IL-1R1 and via the production of chemokines, causes neutrophil recruitment (Sadik et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2006). ASC specks are also released, and can be taken up providing neighbouring cells with the molecular platform to facilitate caspase-1 cleavage, without inflammasome activation (Franklin et al., 2014). As a large protein complex, ASC can also act as a seed for proteins to attach to thus contributing to its inflammatory activity (Venegas et al., 2017; Friker et al., 2020).\n\nWhile it is well established that NLRP3 requires PTMs and structural conformation changes to become active, it also undergoes changes in its cellular location, such as from the cytosol to the trans -Golgi network or mitochondria (Andreeva et al., 2021; Wolf et al., 2016; Baik et al., 2023; Misawa et al., 2013). There are also species differences in the NLRP3 binding partners (e.g. NEK7) that can influence its activity (Y et al., 2016). How these factors come together and regulate NLRP3 activation in a time and location-dependent manner remain to be fully elucidated.\n\nWhat makes NLRP3 a very interesting sensor and later inflammasome complex, is that many different kinds of signals trigger assembly of this  protein,  ranging  from  changes  in  potassium  concentration  (Mu ˜ n et al., 2013), crystals such as cholesterol (Duewell et al., 2010) or uric acid  crystals  (Martinon  et  al.,  2006),  and  protein  aggregates  like  A β (Halle et al., 2008; Sheedy et al., 2013; Heneka et al., 2013) that induce mitochondrial  stress  or  lysosomal  dysfunction.  Due  to  this,  NLRP3 inflammasome  activation  has  been  found  across  many  different  and seemingly unconnected diseases, from atherosclerosis (Duewell et al., 2010), gout (Goldberg et al., 2017), multiple sclerosis (Coll et al., 2015) and AD (Heneka et al., 2013). Together this demonstrates that NLRP3 is an overall sensor of cell stress and a key pharmaceutical target of interest in treating these different conditions.",

        "content": "A number of inflammasome complexes have been examined in the development of AD, including NLRP1 and AIM2 (reviewed here (Heneka et  al.,  2018)).  However,  in  the  brain,  NLRP3  is  the  most  studied inflammasome complex to date. Microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation  occurs  in  a  very  similar  fashion  as  that  described  for  macrophages. A β and tau are first phagocytosed by TLR2, TLR4 and other scavenger receptors (Sheedy et al., 2013; Ries and Sastre, 2016; Meng et  al.,  2022;  McManus,  2022).  A β can  trigger  NLRP3  inflammasome activation via lysosomal disruption and the release of cathepsin D (Halle et  al.,  2008).  Both  oligomeric  and  fibrillar  A β can  activate  NLRP3, inducing the production of cleaved-caspase-1 and active IL-1 β (Fig. 2), although the intensity of this production is less than that observed for nigericin for example (Lu ˇ ci ¯ unait ˙ e et al., 2020). Indeed, the signals used to prime and activate NLRP3 can induce different degrees of inflammasome  activation  and  the  production  of  downstream  components, where  microbial  factors  (e.g.  nigericin)  are  much  more  potent  and pyroptotic  than  sterile  inflammatory  triggers  (e.g.  ATP  or  A β )  (Bezbradica et al., 2017). NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been found in both the brain and periphery of patients with AD pathology (Heneka et al., 2013; Saresella et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2020). Specifically, the monocytes  of  AD  patients  have  greater  production  of  caspase-1  and IL-1 β to  NLRP3-activating  stimuli  (Saresella  et  al.,  2016).  Increased protein levels of cleaved caspase-1, active IL-1 β ,  cleaved GSDMD and ASC have been found in the post mortem brain tissue of AD patients, in comparison with non-demented, age matched controls (Venegas et al., 2017; Heneka et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2020; McManus et al., 2022; Ising et al., 2019). AD patients also have increased IL-1 β and GSDMD in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) than healthy controls (Shen et al., 2021). A common product of NLRP3 inflammasome activation is the production of IL-18, although to date, this has not been studied much in relation to AD. It has been observed that IL-18 is increased in the post mortem brain tissue of those with AD (Ojala et al., 2009), and it can enhance neuronal production of A β in vitro (Sutinen et al., 2012).\n\nIn striking similarity to that observed in humans, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome has been found by a number of research groups in various animal models of AD, including the APP/PS1 and 5xFAD models (Heneka et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2020; McManus et al., 2022). Using the APP/PS1 mouse model, deletion of NLRP3 protected the mice from neuroinflammation, A β plaque deposition and the resulting cognitive impairment (Heneka et al., 2013).  Although  it  is  not  known  exactly when  NLRP3  inflammasome  activation  occurs  in  patients,  using  the\n\nR.M. McManus and E. Latz\n\nAPP/PS1  animal  model,  we  have  found  that  NLRP3  inflammasome activation  directly  parallels  the  initial  A β deposition  at  6  months (McManus et al., 2022), confirming how closely linked these phenomena are with each other. It is important to note a recent study where NLRP3 or caspase-1 deletion did not affect A β load in their APP/PS1 mouse model (Srinivasan et al., 2024). However, the authors did not assess the levels of any inflammasome components in the brains of these mice  (e.g.  cleaved  caspase-1,  IL-1 β ,  GSDMD,  ASC),  nor  learning  or memory paradigms, therefore it is challenging to interpret the discrepancy in amyloid deposition across these studies.\n\nA β also triggers microglial release of ASC specks, which act as a seed that  A β can  bind  to,  further  enhancing  amyloid  pathology  (Venegas et al., 2017). These ASC-A β composites are highly inflammatory, and cause greater IL-1 β production than either ASC or A β alone in primed microglial cells (Friker et al., 2020).\n\nTau, which is found in AD and in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), also triggers activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in patients (Ising et al., 2019) and in animal models of disease such as the Tau22 and Tau301S  mouse  models  (Ising  et  al.,  2019;  Stancu  et  al.,  2019).  In striking similarity to that observed for A β , absence of NLRP3 or ASC in the  Tau22  or  301S  model  of  FTD  rescues  tauopathy,  reduces  neuroinflammation and improves cognitive performance (Ising et al., 2019; Stancu et al., 2019).\n\nIt has recently been demonstrated that myelin damage also occurs in AD, and in models of 5xFAD demyelination enhanced A β deposition (Depp et al., 2023). Similarly, western diet impairs lesion recovery in murine models, which was associated with cholesterol crystal-loaded microglial  cells  (Bosch-Queralt  et  al.,  2021).  Lipids  can  activate NLRP3  (Liang  et  al.,  2021),  as  observed  with  western  diet-induced cholesterol  crystals  that  contribute  to  heart  disease  (Duewell  et  al., 2010). It is interesting to speculate whether impaired lipid signalling might also be inducing NLRP3 inflammasome activation in those with AD.",

        "content": "The  first  therapies  to  target  the  NLRP3  inflammasome  pathway focused  on  IL-1 β (Fig.  2).  Three  compounds  have  had  great  success: Anakinra  (a  recombinant  IL-1  receptor  antagonist)  canakinumab  (a human IgG monoclonal antibody that targets IL-1 β ) and rilonacept (a soluble decoy receptor containing domains of IL-1R1 and IL-1RAcP that also  binds  IL-1 β )  (Dubois et al.,  2011).  Anakinra and rilonacept also block IL-1 α .  These three compounds are FDA-approved to treat those with Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) who have a mutation in NLRP3, and to date are the only approved therapies for this condition (Booshehri and Hoffman, 2019). They have been used effectively in other diseases that have NLRP3 involvement, such as arthritis, gout or pericarditis (Mertens and Singh, 2009; Broderick and Hoffman, 2022).\n\nIn animal models, anakinra could reduce A β and Tau deposition, and lowered IL-1 β together attenuating cognitive deficits in the 3xTg AD model  (Kitazawa  et  al.,  2011).  Anakinra  or  IL-1r GLYPH&lt;0&gt; / GLYPH&lt;0&gt; also  attenuated A β -induced mitochondrial and memory impairments in vitro and in vivo (Batista et al., 2021). In AD, there is currently an active, phase 2 clinical trial  with  canakinumab  for  those  with  MCI  or  AD  (NCT04795466). These individuals receive canakinumab for 20 weeks, with later follow up visits where cognition and behaviour, and microglial activation by positron emission tomography (PET) will be assessed at various timepoints throughout the study. The estimated completion is spring 2024, therefore  it  will  be  very  interesting  to  see  the  effectiveness  of  this therapy. Only a few studies have specifically targeted IL-1 β in animal models or clinical trials of AD. This is perhaps due to issues crossing the Blood-brain barrier (BBB), where anakinra can pass more easily than canakinumab for example (Sj ¨ ostr ¨ o et al., 2021). Although as the BBB is more open in AD (Ryu and McLarnon, 2009), this should facilitate some treatments accessing the brain. However, IL-1 β is only one downstream mediator, targeting NLRP3 directly or partners in the inflammasome complex would likely have a greater impact.",

Caspase-1 deficiency protected APP/PS1 (Heneka et al., 2013) and J20 mice (Flores et al., 2018) from developing amyloid pathology, neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits.\n\nVX-765 is a well-characterised small molecule inhibitor of caspase-1 (also acting on caspase-4). It is a pro-drug, that upon uptake is acted upon by plasma esterases, converting VX-765 into an active peptidomimetic  metabolite,  VRT-043198,  that  bonds  with  the  active  site  of caspase-1 thus blocking its activity. In the J20 mouse model of AD, VX765  rescued  spatial  memory  impairment,  reduced  microgliosis  and significantly attenuated A β deposition in the 5 -8-month-old mice (Flores et al., 2018). It is important to note that the memory deficits returned when the VX-765 treatment was stopped, indicating the need to regularly inhibit this pathway to maintain protective effects. In older (12 -15 month) J20 mice, VX-765 was still able to rescue memory impairments by boosting performance in the novel objection recognition and Barnes maze tests (Flores et al., 2022). Interestingly VX-765 was no longer able to  reduce  microglial  activity  in  the  older  J20  animals  (assessed  by Iba1-staining), nor did it reduce neuroinflammation or A β deposition, suggesting  a  divergence  in  pathways  contributing  to  the  age-related memory loss in this model (Flores et al., 2022).",

CRID3 (or CP-456773, MCC950) is a specific, commercially available inhibitor  of  NLRP3.  Interestingly,  it  was  known  for  many  years  that CRID3  could  block  IL-1 β ,  but  it  was  only  in  2015  that  CRID3  was identified  as  a  specific  NLRP3  inflammasome  inhibitor  (Coll  et  al., 2015). We now understand that CRID3 acts within the NACHT domain of NLRP3 to prevent its activity (Coll et al., 2019). Using cryo-electron microscopy,  Hochheiser  and  colleagues  recently  demonstrated  that CRID3  binds  into  a  specific  cleft  within  NLRP3,  that  connects  four NACHT subdomains with an LRR transition segment. Having unravelled the precise site of action of CRID3, this will undoubtedly facilitate the design of better, more potent inhibitors moving forward (Hochheiser et al., 2022a). While CRID3 has been used in clinical trials, it has high plasma protein binding (Primiano et al., 2016) and it unfortunately can induce liver toxicity in humans at higher concentrations (Torres et al., 2021; Mangan et al., 2018; Cross, 2020). This makes the compound ideal for mechanistic studies in vitro and in vivo ,  but obviously less so as a therapy for patients.\n\nIn terms of AD, CRID3 effectively blocked the A β (Lu ˇ ci ¯ unait ˙ e et al., 2020; McManus et al., 2022; Dempsey et al., 2017) or Tau (Ising et al., 2019; Stancu et al., 2019)-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro , preventing cleavage and release of caspase-1 and IL-1 β . In animal models, CRID3 could prevent the production of IL-1 β , reduced A β deposition and rescued memory impairments in the APP/PS1 model of AD (Dempsey et al., 2017). CRID3 also reduced Tau seeding in the P301S model  of  Tauopathy,  and  attenuated  the  Tau-induced  microgliosis (Stancu et al., 2019).\n\nThere  are  a  number  of  other  NLRP3  inflammasome  inhibitors  at various  stages  of  pre-clinical  (IFM-514  (Torres  et  al.,  2021),  CY-09 (Wang  et  al.,  2021))  or  clinical  trials  such  as  DFV890  (IFM-2427) (Madurka  et  al.,  2023),  OLT1177  (Marchetti  et  al.,  2018),  Tranilast (Huang et al., 2018), Oridonin (He et al., 2018), Selnoflast (McFarthing et al., 2023) or Inzomelid (IZD174) (Coll et al., 2022), see Table 1 for details.

OLT1177 reduces the ATPase activity of NLRP3, it  likely  binds  to that region (Marchetti et al., 2018). A recent study found  that  OLT1177  does  not  directly  bind  to  NLRP3  (Teske  et  al., 2024), however, this does not detract from the effectiveness of OLT1177 at preventing the release of active IL-1 β (Marchetti et al., 2018; Tengesdal et al., 2021; Oizumi et al., 2022; Lonnemann et al., 2020) and the promising  findings  from  the  ongoing  clinical  trials  (Table  1).  The structures of most of the compounds are not yet publicly available, thus it is unknown where they precisely bind to prevent NLRP3 inflammasome signalling. However, as some of these inhibitors are in clinical trials for those with Parkinson ' s disease or ALS (Selnoflast and ZYIL1) and  many  compounds are  additionally  BBB  penetrant  (Table  1),  the results of these trials will be of interest to many with strong implications for future treatments of AD.",

        "content": "An alternative approach to prevent NLRP3 inflammasome signalling has been to reduce the mRNA levels of NLRP3, thus affecting the amount translated  to  protein.  Anti-sense  oligonucleotides  (ASOs)  function  by targeting  a  specific  mRNA  for  degradation  and  SOD1-targeted  ASOs have recently been used in clinical trials to treat Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Miller et al., 2022). Interestingly, NLRP3-targeted ASOs were successfully able to reduce the protein levels of NLRP3, thus also significantly reducing NLRP3 inflammasome activation to nigericin and A β stimulation, in both human and murine in vitro models of disease\n\n(Braatz et al., 2023). NLRP3-specific ASOs were also protective in murine models of CAPS, which reduced the production of NLRP3 and active IL-1 β ,  prolonging  the  survival  time  of  these  mice  (Kaufmann  et  al., 2023).\n\nIn  a  similar  fashion,  small  interfering  RNA  (siRNA)  also  targets mRNA for  degradation.  Injecting  caspase-1-targeted  siRNA  (under  a AAV) into APP/PS1 mice significantly reduced neuroinflammation and rescued behavioural function in these animals (Han et al., 2020). In vitro , siRNA  targeting  of  caspase-1  and  GSDMD  successfully  reduced  the amount of IL-1 β released  to  the  supernatant  after  A β exposure  (Han et al., 2020), although GSDMD inhibition or depletion has not yet been examined in murine models of AD.",

        "content": "Camelids (e.g. camels or alpacas) generate single domain antibodies that are derived from heavy chain peptides. They are approx. 15 kDa in size, one tenth that of a conventional antibody. Nanobodies bind with high affinity and specificity, are very stable and due to their small size, they  can  overcome  limitations  posed  by  conventional  antibodies allowing them to bind previously inaccessible epitopes (Wouters et al., 2020). Nanobodies against ASC have been developed, which successfully blocked ASC-CARD  interactions in vitro thus reducing the nigericin-induced cleaved-caspase-1 and active IL-1 β production (Schmidt et al., 2016). In vivo , these ASC-targeted nanobodies were able to  prevent  ASC  prion  activity,  disassemble  ASC  specks  and  were\n\nR.M. McManus and E. Latz protective  against  disease  progression  in  murine  models  of  gout  and arthritis (Bertheloot et al., 2022). GSDMD nanobodies have also been developed that inhibit the formation of GSDMD pores in vitro (Hochheiser et al., 2022b).\n\nTo date, nanobodies have largely targeted extracellular components of the inflammasome pathways, due to the challenge of entering the cell. Another challenge that occurs in these approaches for neurodegenerative diseases is that the nanobody would also need to cross the BBB to access the brain parenchyma. Interestingly, brain-penetrant nanobodies have been developed. In this case, Wouters and colleagues developed a nanobody to target the transferrin receptor (that is highly expressed on endothelial cells) and coupled this nanobody to their target of interest, which successfully accessed the CNS after receptor-mediated endocytosis (Wouters et al., 2020). This Trojan-horse like system is a novel way to access the brain and as nanobodies can be readily linked to other nanobodies or peptides (Bannas et al., 2017; Abskharon et al., 2023), their use has the potential to revolutionize therapies in many diseases.",

        "content": "There is a clinically unmet need to protect against age-related diseases, particularly AD and dementia. As we live in an aging society, this situation is confounded by the number of people who will develop dementia and require enhanced care in the coming years. A key reason for this has been the lack of understanding on the mechanisms that lead to the development of AD, and importantly, the immune mediated aspects. We now know that the NLRP3 inflammasome is triggered by the growing presence of A β and tau in the brain, inducing production of active IL-1 β and ASC specks. This causes a feed-forward inflammatory cycle, where IL-1 β and ASC act on neighbouring brain cells or in the case of ASC, provide  a  platform  to  further  enhance  A β aggregation,  thus  causing physical disruption along with additional DAMP-signals to cells. Under these  inflammatory  conditions,  the  microglial  phagocytic  capacities reduce  (Koenigsknecht-Talboo  and  Landreth,  2005),  which  also  contributes to the worsening pathology.\n\nPreclinical  studies  have  shown  the  benefits  of  preventing  NLRP3 inflammasome signalling, by genetic depletion of NLRP3 components and binding factors or pharmacological inhibition. Indeed there are now a number of approaches under investigation to block this complex, from mRNA-targeted  therapies,  nanobodies  and  novel  small  molecule  inhibitors as discussed in this review. An important factor is that the inhibitors need to reach the brain by crossing the BBB, which adds a layer of complexity that is not required for other NLRP3-mediated diseases. With the recent introduction of A β -targeted therapies, a combination approach with NLRP3 inhibition would be relevant, with the potential to boost the effects of either treatment alone.",

It  is  a  heterogeneous  disease  with  complex pathobiology  [4].  It  is  characterized  clinically  by  progressive  loss  of memory  and  other  cognitive  functions  [5],  and  in  advanced  stages, patients may experience severe amnesic manifestations, hallucinations, disorientation,  and  ultimately  death  due  to  malnutrition,  dysphagia, aspiration pneumonia, and infection [6].\n\nThe onset of AD may be caused by a complex interplay of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors [5]. The core pathological features of AD are amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain,  with  associated  synaptic  and  neuronal  damage,  resulting  in cognitive deficits [7]. Amyloidβ (A β ) peptide and Tau protein are the main components of plaques and tangles, respectively [8]. A β peptides are  proteolytic  fragments  of  the  transmembrane  amyloid  precursor protein,  and substantial evidence supported a central role for pathological A β accumulation in the pathogenesis of AD [9]. A β is toxic to neurons in several  aspects,  leading  to  the  development  of  apoptosis, synaptic loss, and cytoskeletal disruption [10].\n\nTau  is  a  microtubule-associated  protein  in  the  brain.  Hyperphosphorylated  Tau  fibrillates  into  paired  helical  filaments  and  thus form NFTs in AD compared with healthy brains [11]. Many studies have shown  that  the  number  and  location  of  NFTs  are  closely  related  to neuronal  loss,  AD  disease  severity,  and  clinical  course  [12,13].  In addition,  growing  evidence  showed  that  A β and  Tau  interact.  For example,  abnormal  Tau  phosphorylation  increases  A β production  by trapping amyloid precursor protein (APP)-containing endosomes; meanwhile, A β oligomers drive Tau hyperphosphorylation, creating a vicious cycle that leads to the perpetuation of AD pathology [11].\n\nNo drugs are currently available to slow AD progression [3]. Marketed  cholinesterase  inhibitors  and  N-methyl  D-aspartate  antagonists provide only symptomatic relief, and their clinical importance remains controversial [14]. Considering the complex and multifactorial pathology of AD, TCM is safer than synthetic drugs with single-target activity, and it contains multiple active ingredients that could act on multiple targets simultaneously and exert a synergistic intervention in patients with AD [15]. For example, Polygonum multiflorum Thunb. (He Shou Wu) extract, Acrorus tatarinowii Schott (Shi Chang Pu) extract [16], Polygala tenuifolia Willd. (Yuan Zhi) extract [17], Coptis chinensis Franch (Huang Lian) extract [18], modified Huanglian-Jie-Du-Tang [19], and NeuroDefend [20] have been shown to improve AD pathological damage and alleviate  cognitive  deficits.  Clinical  trials  have  shown  that  TCM  has positive effects on early AD prevention and the improvement of cognition and brain activity in patients with AD [21]. Further exploration of the  regulatory  mechanisms  of  AD-related  signal  pathways  could  be beneficial to reveal the therapeutic targets of herbal interventions in AD. However, a systematic review of signal pathways in TCM interventions in AD research has not been conducted. Therefore, this study reviewed the research progress of the signal pathways of TCM and its effective active ingredients against AD in recent years to provide a reference for subsequent studies.",

        "title": "2.1. NFκ B signal pathway",
        "content": "Nuclear factorκ B (NFκ B) is a family of transcription factors that play  vital  roles  in  inflammation,  immunity,  cell  proliferation,  and apoptosis. In mammals, the NFκ B transcription factor family consists of five proteins: p65 (RelA), c-Rel, RelB, p105/p50, and p100/p52 [22]. All of the above members contain an N-terminal Rel homology domain and could form homodimers or heterodimers. In quiescent cells, these dimers bind to the inhibitor of NFκ B (I κ B) protein, and inactive transcription factors are sequestered in the cytoplasm. Upon  stimulation by pro-inflammatory  cytokines,  such  as  tumor  necrosis  factor  (TNF)α , interleukin (IL) GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 β , and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), I κ B protein is phosphorylated by the I κ B kinase complex, leading to ubiquitination and  degradation  of  I κ B  protein  and  thus  resulting  in  NFκ B  dimer translocating to the nucleus and driving transcription of target genes [23].  The  NFκ B  signal  pathway  is  considered  to  be  a  critical  signal pathway involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses [24]. It regulates  the  transcription  of  genes  such  as  cytokines,  chemokines, pro-inflammatory enzymes, pro-inflammatory transcription factors, and adhesion  molecules,  which  are  all  essential  for  regulating  neuroinflammation [25].\n\nGrowing evidence showed that neuroinflammation has an essential role  in  the  pathogenesis of  AD [1]. Astrocytes and microglia are the primary resident cells responsible for  the  immune/inflammatory response in the brain [26]. Misfolded and aggregated proteins in the brain could bind to microglia and astrocytes, triggering an innate immune response characterized by the release of inflammatory cytokines and ultimately leading to the development of chronic neuroinflammation  and  promoting  the  progression  of  AD  disease  [27]. Furthermore, NFκ B has binding sites in the promoter regions of genes involved in amyloidogenesis and inflammation, and long-term use of NSAIDs may prevent AD progression and delay its onset [28]. NFκ B is closely associated with the development of AD.\n\nBaicalin (BAI) is a natural flavonoid isolated from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (Huang Qin), which is of interest for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in various neurological diseases [29]. After BAI intervention, the number of Iba-1-positive microglia in the brain of APP/PS1 double transgenic mice was reduced; the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin (IL) GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 β , and IL-18 were decreased; and the expression levels of nod-like receptor protein  3  (NLRP3),  TLR4,  p-NFκ B/p65,  and  p-I κ B α proteins  were reduced. These findings suggested that BAI could alleviate microglia-induced  neuroinflammation  in  the  brain  of  AD  mice  by inhibiting NLRP3 and TLR4/NFκ B signal pathways and promote the improvement of memory and cognitive deficits. Furthermore, in BV-2 microglia, BAI attenuated  LPS/A β -induced neuroinflammation by inhibiting NLRP3 and TLR4/NFκ B signal pathways [30].\n\nWang et al. [31] found that NaoXinTong (NXT) capsule alleviated spatial memory impairment and cognitive decline in APP/PS1 double transgenic mice; downregulated IL-1 β , IL-6, and TNFα ; inhibited NFκ B and TLR4 expression; and decreased A β and p-Tau levels. These findings suggested  that  NXT  may  delay  AD  progression  by  inhibiting  the TLR4/NFκ B/IL-1 β signal pathway, antagonizing the neuroinflammatory response, and delaying AD progression. The Chinese herb Sesamum  indicum L.  (Zhi  Ma)  is  rich  in  sesame  oil  (SO),  which  has pharmacological  effects  such  as  anti-inflammatory,  antioxidant,  and antitumor  [32].  Mohamed  et  al.  [33]  found  that  SO  significantly improved the learning and memory impairment induced by AlCl3  in mice,  decreased  acetylcholinesterase  (AChE)  and  A β levels,  downregulated TNFα and IL-1 β , decreased NFκ B and p38MAPK expression levels,  and  increased  BDNF  and  PPARγ expression.  These  findings suggested that SO attenuated neuroinflammation and oxidative stress damage and promoted cognitive recovery by regulating the NFκ B/p38MAPK/BDNF/PPARγ signal pathway.\n\nMoreover, the herbal compounds Sanweidoukou decoction [34] and Qifu-Yin [35] and the natural herbal active ingredients tanshinone IIA [36], Forsythoside B [37], and Corydalis edulis total alkaloid [38] have shown  considerable  effects  in  promoting  cognitive  performance  and preventing AD by mechanisms related to the inhibition of the NFκ B signal pathway and the reduction of neuroinflammatory response.\n\nIn summary, chronic neuroinflammation is one of the core mechanisms of AD. The NFκ B signal pathway is a classical regulatory pathway of the inflammatory response. It could be targeted by TCM, and it is a pivotal target to slow down the progression of AD disease.",

        "title": "2.2. Nrf2 signal pathway",
        "content": "The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key transcription factor in antioxidant defense, and it intersects with many other\n\nM.-R. Ding et al.\n\nsignaling  cascade  responses  [39].  Nrf2  belongs  to  the  Cap ' n ' Collar subfamily of the basic region-leucine zipper transcription factors and consists of seven conserved NRF2-ECH homology structural domains, each  with  a  different  function  [40].  Under  physiological  conditions, Kelchlike ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) inhibits Nrf2 activation by isolating  Nrf2  in  the  cytoplasm  and  targets  Nrf2  ubiquitination.  By contrast, under oxidative stress conditions, with the production of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), Nrf2 dissociates from Keap1 and translocates  to  the  nucleus,  where  it  binds  to  the  antioxidant  responsive element (ARE) to trigger transcription of downstream antioxidant enzymes, such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) [41].\n\nOxidative stress is known to play a vital role in developing AD [42]. Excessive  accumulation  of  ROS  associated  with  oxidative  stress  may promote  A β deposition  and  Tau  hyperphosphorylation  and  lead  to subsequent synaptic and neuronal loss, affecting synaptic activity and neurotransmission in neurons and leading to cognitive dysfunction [43]. Evidence showed that oxidative stress was manifested early in the course of AD [44], and decreased expression of Nrf2 [45] and its target genes NQO1 [46], HO-1 [47], GCLC, and glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier (GCLM) [48] were observed in the brains of patients with AD. Moreover, ongoing  evidence  highlighted  the  protective  role  of  the  Nrf2  signal pathway in AD. Activation of Nrf2 upregulated the expression of antioxidant  enzymes  and  various  proteins  that  reduce  oxidative  stress damage and neuroinflammation, thereby delaying the progression of AD [49].\n\nVarious Chinese herbs have been shown to activate the Nrf2 signal pathway.  For  example,  Rhynchophylline  (Rhy)  is  the  main  active component of the medicinal herb Uncaria rhynchophylla (Miq.) Jacks. (Gou  Teng),  which  has  been  shown  in  many  studies  to  ameliorate cognitive deficits in animal AD models [50]. Jiang et al. [51] used Rhy to intervene in an A β 1 -42-induced mouse model of AD and found that the treated mice showed improved cognitive function; reduced brain ROS and  MDA  levels;  increased  GSH  levels;  and  significantly  increased expression  of  Nrf2  and  its  downstream  proteins  HO-1,  NOQ1,  and GCLM.  Rhy  could  exert  antioxidative  stress  effects  and  attenuate A β 1 -42-induced neurotoxicity through activating the Nrf2/ARE signal pathway, with positive therapeutic effects in AD mice.\n\nQin et al. [52] found that Astragalus polysaccharide increased the expression of Nrf2 in the nucleus and the expression of SOD and GSH-Px, and  reduced  the  accumulation  of  MDA,  thereby  reducing  oxidative stress damage and significantly improving the spatial learning memory ability of APP/PS1 mice. Bian et al. [53] reported that oxyphylla A, an extract of Alpinia oxyphylla Miq. (Yi Zhi), contributed to the improvement of  cognitive  function  in  senescence-accelerated  mouse  prone  8 mice by reducing the expression of APP, A β 1 -40, and A β 1 -42 in the brain. The antioxidant mechanism was associated with increased expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes HO-1 and NQO1 in the brain and the inhibition of the expression of Nrf2 regulatory protein Keap1.\n\nVarious herbal active ingredients could slow down the progression of AD.  For  example, Centella  asiatica (L.)  Urb.  (Ji  Xue  Cao)  improved cognitive performance and reduced A β deposition in the brain of 5 × Familial Alzheimer ' s disease (5XFAD) mice; it acted by increasing the expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes HO-1, NQO1, and GCLC [54,55].

They are potential therapeutic agents for alleviating AD pathology.",

        "title": "2.3. Nrf2 and NFκ B signal pathway interplay in AD",
        "content": "Recent studies have found that interacting oxidative disorders and neuroinflammation underlie the pathological mechanisms of AD [58]. Oxidative stress results from the excessive release of ROS in the brain [59]. ROS can induce glial cell activation, stimulate the expression of inflammatory  cytokines,  and  trigger  chronic  neuroinflammation.  In turn, continuously activated microglia and astrocytes can produce large amounts of ROS, thus promoting oxidative stress [60]. Oxidative stress and deleterious inflammation form a vicious cycle that synergistically promotes AD development [61]. This cycle involves stimulating transcription factors, such as NFκ B and Nrf2, that are sensitive to oxidative stress and inflammation.\n\nNFκ B is the main transcription factor that controls the expression of pro-inflammatory  genes  in  microglia  [62].  Nrf2  is  a  redox-sensitive transcription factor located in the cytoplasm that helps cells adapt to oxidative stress and chronic inflammation by upregulating the expression of protective genes [63]. The Nrf2 and NFκ B signal pathways are vital pathways that synergistically regulate the balance between cellular redox  status  and  inflammatory  responses  [49].  The  current  study showed that downregulation of Nrf2 could increase in NFκ B activity and promote the expression of inflammatory markers. Nrf2 interacts with  NFκ B  to  coordinate  antioxidant  stress  and  inflammatory  responses,  and  it  may  be  a  promising  target  against  AD  pathological progression.\n\nRecent studies have continued to point out that in addition to being a central  regulator  of  the  antioxidant  stress  response,  the  Nrf2  signal pathway plays an essential role in suppressing inflammation. The Nrf2 signal pathway is often accompanied by inhibition of the NFκ B signal pathway and diminished inflammatory response [64 -66]. Reduction in intracellular ROS to inhibit oxidative stress-mediated NFκ B activation, upregulation of HO-1 expression to prevent I κ Bα proteasomal degradation, and inhibition of NFκ B nuclear translocation were also found [67]. Common Nrf2 agonists, including sulforaphane [68], astaxanthin [69],  curcumin  [70],  and  epigallocatechin-3-gallate  [71],  have  been found  to  exert  anti-inflammatory  properties  by  inhibiting  the  NFκ B signal pathway.\n\nIn addition to inflammatory damage, NFκ B is involved in regulating oxidative stress response. NFκ B could regulate the transcription and activity of Nrf2, with positive or negative effects on the expression of its target genes [72]. NFκ B could regulate the expression of various antioxidant  proteases,  including  manganese  superoxide  dismutase  [73], glutathione transferase [74], and HO-1 [75]. The NFκ B/p65 subunit could inhibit the Nrf2/ARE signal pathway by depriving CREB binding protein from Nrf2 [76], and Nrf2 target genes, such as NQO1, GCLC, and GCLM, have NFκ B binding sites [67].\n\nGrowing evidence showed that TCM and its active ingredients have positive effects on the complex interaction mechanisms between Nrf2 and NFκ B signal pathways, and this may be an essential strategy to combat AD. As the main active ingredient of Citrus  reticulata Blanco (Chen Pi) [77], Hesperidin (HP) is a common neuroprotective agent that has received much  attention for its significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory  properties  in  neurodegenerative  diseases  [78].  HP treatment  significantly  ameliorated  cognitive  function  in  APP/PS1 double transgenic mice; increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px in the brain; increased Nrf2 and HO-1 expression; decreased inflammatory cytokines TNFα , C-reactive protein, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels; and inhibited p-I κ B α protein  expression  and  NFκ B/p65 nuclear  translocation.  These  findings suggested  that  HP  could  inhibit  oxidative  stress  injury  and  neuroinflammation in the brain of AD mice by upregulating Nrf2 expression and  inhibiting  NFκ B  signal  pathway,  ultimately  promoting  their cognitive function [79].\n\nLei  et  al.  [80]  investigated  the  therapeutic  effects  of  pinoresinol\n\nM.-R. Ding et al.\n\ndiglucoside  (PDG),  the  main  active  ingredient  of Eucommia  ulmoides Oliv.  (Du  Zhong),  on  cognitive  impairment  in  an  A β 1 -42-induced AD mouse model. PDG was found to significantly improve cognitive performance, reduce the levels of ROS and MDA, increase the release of SOD and CAT in the brain, and increase the protein expression of Nrf2 and  HO-1  in  the  hippocampus  of  AD  mice.  PDG  also  decreased  the release  levels  of  IL-1 β and  TNFα and  downregulated  the  protein expression of NFκ B/p65. Furthermore, the Bcl-2/Bax ratio was upregulated  in  the  brains  of  PDG-treated  mice,  the  protein  expression  of cytochrome C and cleaved caspase-3 was reduced, and A β 1 -42-induced neuronal apoptosis was inhibited. These findings indicated that PDG could  effectively  regulate  oxidative  stress  state,  inflammation,  and neuronal apoptosis by activating the Nrf2/NFκ B transcriptional pathway,  thus  reducing  neuronal  damage  and  improving  cognitive dysfunction, which has a certain therapeutic effect on AD mice.\n\nIn-vitro data showed that isoliquiritigenin, the active ingredient of the  Chinese  herb Glycyrrhiza  uralensis Fisch.  (Gan  Cao),  reduced  the production  of  inflammatory  cytokines  iNOS,  COX-2,  IL-1 β ,  IL-6,  and TNFα by upregulating the expression of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 and inhibiting NFκ B activation [81]. This study suggested that activating Nrf2 antagonizes NFκ B activity and thus exerts anti-inflammatory effects. Besides, the active ingredients of TCM, such as platycodin D [82], higenamine  [83], α -cyperone  [84],  sulforaphane  [85],  and  lycopene [86], exhibited certain neuroprotective activities. The mechanisms were related  to  anti-inflammatory  and  antioxidant  properties  through  the regulation of the Nrf2/NFκ B signal pathway.\n\nTo sum up, the onset and development of AD is a complex process caused, in large part, by crosstalk between oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.  NFκ B and Nrf2 signal pathway-mediated  chronic inflammation and oxidative stress contribute to AD development. The synergy between Nrf2 and NFκ B signal pathways is an important entry point for delaying the pathological progression of AD. TCM has multitarget and bi-directional regulation, and the multi-faceted coordination of  NFκ B  and  Nrf2  may  reduce  oxidative  stress,  pathological  neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis in the brains of patients with AD, thus slowing down the progression of AD disease, which is a potential target for the prevention and treatment of AD.",

        "title": "2.4. JAK/STAT signal pathway",
        "content": "The Janus kinase/signal transducer  and activator of  transcription (JAK/STAT)  signal  pathway  is  central to extracellular cytokineactivated receptor-mediated signal transduction. In mammals, the JAK family has four members: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2, and the STAT family  includes  seven  members:  STAT1,  STAT2,  STAT3,  STAT4, STAT5a, STAT5b, and STAT6 [87]. The JAK/STAT signal pathway is involved in regulating several CNS functions, including neurogenesis, gliogenesis,  synaptic  plasticity,  and  microglia  activation.  Aberrant activation  or  phosphorylation  of  its  pathway  components  is  closely associated  with  many  neurodegenerative  diseases,  such  as  AD  [88]. IFNγ and IL-6 are the most potent activators of the JAK/STAT signal pathway  [89].  Interestingly,  both  of  these  cytokines  have  also  been found to be overexpressed in patients with AD [90,91]. Activation of JAK leads to the phosphorylation and dimerization of STATs, which are then transferred from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where they bind to specific DNA elements to regulate the transcription of cytokine-related genes [92]. A growing number of studies have shown that the JAK/STAT signal pathway plays an essential role in AD development [93].\n\nSuan-Zao-Ren decoction (SZRD) is widely used to treat neurological disorders, including dementia, depression, and insomnia, with potential benefits  for  AD  treatment.  Long  et  al.  [94]  observed  changes  in  the expression of the JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway in an AD mouse model and the effect of SZRD on this pathway. They showed that SZRD intervention significantly reduced cognitive impairment; decreased A β plaque deposition and neuronal loss; improved synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus; decreased p-JAK2-Tyr1007 and p-STAT3-Tyr705 protein expression; and inhibited inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1 β , and TNFα in APP/PS1 mice. These findings suggested that SZRD may be able to improve cognitive deficits in AD mice by downregulating the JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway to reduce A β deposition and neuroinflammation.\n\nCornel iridoid glycoside (CIG) is a terpenoid extracted from Cornus officinalis Sieb.et Zucc. (Shan Zhu Yu) [95], with neuroprotective effects [96,97]. Ma et al. [98] found that CIG reduced the protein expression of p-JAK2, p-STAT1, and STAT1 and increased the expression levels of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B  and α -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole  propionic  acid receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluA1 in the brain of P301S transgenic mice. This finding suggested that CIG could alleviate STAT1-induced inhibition  of  NMDAR  expression  by  inhibiting  the  JAK2/STAT1  signal pathway, thereby increasing synaptic ultrastructure and number in the brain, improving synaptic plasticity, and ultimately effectively improving cognitive function in AD mice.\n\nIn  addition,  many  herbal  medicines  and  their  active  ingredients could delay the progression of AD pathology. For instance, ganoderic acid A significantly improved cognitive deficits in d-gal-treated mice by inhibiting the Th17 cell-induced JAK/STAT signal pathway and regulating Treg cells to enhance mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, thus  improving  brain  mitochondrial  dysfunction  and  reduce  neuroinflammation [99]. Curcumin, a natural polyphenolic compound [100], has  been  proven  to  have  a  potential  therapeutic  effect  in  inhibiting neuroinflammation  by  a  mechanism  related  to  the  regulation  of  the JAK/STAT/SOCS signal pathway [101].",

Because  of  its ability to degrade misfolded and easily aggregated abnormal proteins, this  pathway plays an important role in maintaining normal cellular metabolism  and  avoiding  protein  dysfunction.  The  main  pathways include the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) and the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP) [103].",

        "title": "2.5.1. Ubiquitin-proteasome pathway",
        "content": "In eukaryotes, the vast majority of protein degradation takes place via UPP. UPP relies on ubiquitin (Ub) signals to target proteins to the proteasome  and  to  achieve  ubiquitination  and  degradation  of  target proteins in a highly coordinated manner [104]. Ubiquitination is tightly controlled by the enzymatic cascade reaction. The cascade reaction is initiated by Ub activation catalyzed by the Ub-activating enzyme (E1), followed by the formation of a high-energy thioester bond between the E1 enzyme and activated Ub, thus transferring Ub to the Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2). Next the Ub-ligase enzyme (E3) binds the E2 enzyme to the target protein and transfers Ub to the substrate, where the E3 enzyme determines  the  substrate  specificity  of  the  protein.  Finally,  the  26  S proteasome recognizes the target protein and undergoes degradation [105].\n\nDue to the critical role of UPP in maintaining protein homeostasis, dysregulation of UPP is receiving sustained attention as an important factor in the pathogenesis of AD which is characterized by massive aggregation of harmful proteins [106]. Significant decreases in proteasome activity have been reported to be observed in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, superior temporal gyri, middle temporal gyri, and inferior parietal lobule in patients with AD compared to controls, indicating impaired proteasome function in AD [107]. The ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated receptor degradation in APP mutant transgenic mice were found to be affected to some extent, and the proteasome and deubiquitinating enzyme activities were also inhibited [108]. In addition, continued evidence suggests that abnormal ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) activity may lead to dysregulated\n\nM.-R. Ding et al.\n\ndegradation of A β and Tau proteins. For example, in the triple transgenic (3xTg)-AD mouse model, blocking UPP by application of proteasome-specific inhibitors was found to result in a significant increase in the accumulation of A β and Tau proteins, while enhancing UPP specifically induced Tau protein degradation and reduced abnormal Tau protein levels in the brains of AD mice [109,110]. Another study pointed out that UPP is involved in the formation of abnormal aggregation of phosphorylated Tau proteins through stress granules, and it highlights the importance of activating UPP for alleviating AD pathology [111]. Therefore, the close association between UPP and the pathogenesis of AD  may  open  new  avenues  for  exploring  therapeutic  strategies  for UPP-based treatment of AD in Chinese herbs, and numerous studies have been reported to support this view.\n\nIyaswamy et al. [112] found that Yuan-Hu Zhi Tong Prescription (YZT)  significantly  improved  learning,  memory  function  and  motor deficits  in  P301S  Tau  and  3xTg-AD  mice;  reduced  the  load  of  phosphorylated  Tau  protein  in  the  brain;  and  decreased  ploy  Ub  protein levels. These findings suggested that YZT may exert anti-AD activity by modulating UPP to promote degradation of insoluble Tau aggregates. Sreenivasmurthy et al. [113] investigated the neuroprotective effects of protopine (PRO), a component of Corydalis yanhusuo W.T. Wang (Yan Hu Suo), on P301S Tau and 3xTg-AD mouse models. PRO was found to significantly improve learning and memory abilities; attenuate Tau pathology; inhibit histone deacetylase 6 activity; and enhance the molecular  chaperones  heat  shock  protein  70  (HSP70),  HSP90,  heat  shock cognate 70 (HSC70), and acetylated HSP90 protein expression.\n\nIn addition, Li et al. [114] found that Yuan-zhi-san (YZS) improved memory deficits, restored neuronal numbers, reversed ultrastructural abnormalities and increased dendritic spine density in A β 1 -40-induced AD rat model. The expression levels of UbE1a/b, UbE2a, carboxyl terminus of HSC70-interacting protein, ubiquitin C-236 terminal hydrolase L1, and 26 S proteasome proteins were significantly increased and the hyperphosphorylation of Tau proteins (Ser199 and Thr231) was effectively  inhibited  in  AD rat  brain  after  YZS  intervention.  These  results suggested  that  YZS  could  restore  UPP  function  in  AD  rats,  thus  promoting the degradation of phosphorylated Tau proteins and the recovery of normal neurological function and memory enhancement.",

        "title": "2.5.2. Autophagy -lysosome pathway",
        "content": "Although UPS has been recognized for decades as a key regulator of degradation  of  various  aggregation-prone  proteins,  ALP  has  recently been shown to be an important pathway associated with neuronal health and related diseases [115]. This pathway is specifically responsible for the delivery and digestion of cellular contents, misfolded proteins, and damaged organelles produced during cellular catabolism, thus playing a protective role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, energy balance, and cellular defense [116].\n\nIn mammalian cells, autophagy could be classified into three main subtypes based on differences in target substrate recognition and delivery to lysosome: macroautophagy, microautophagy and chaperonemediated  autophagy  (CMA)  [117].  Among  them,  macroautophagy (hereinafter  referred  to  as ' autophagy ' )  represents  the  majority  of autophagic processes and is the main pathway for removing A β and abnormal Tau proteins [118]. Autophagy is a multistep process. Cytoplasmic cargoes are initially isolated by a phagophore that elongates to form  the  double-membrane  structured  vesicle  called  autophagosome [119]. During this phase, the Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase (ULK)  complex  promotes  phagophore  initiation  and  elongation  by recruiting and activating lipid kinase complexes [120]. This complex catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, allowing further recruitment of specific autophagy proteins necessary for phagophore formation and constituting the active complex autophagy-related gene (ATG) 5-ATG12-ATG12L1. These activities together lead to the binding of microtubule-associated proteins 1 A/1B Light Chain 3B (LC3) and Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein family members to phosphatidylethanolamine, resulting in the formation of LC3-II, a major marker of autophagy, which also leads to the formation of autophagosome by the extension and closure of  phagophore membrane [121]. Finally,  the  outer  membrane  of  the  autophagosome  fuses  with  the lysosomal membrane to form an autolysosome, allowing lysosomal hydrolases to degrade autophagic cargoes and release the recovered nutrients back into the cytoplasm for reuse [117].\n\nIn contrast to non-neuronal cells, neuronal cells are highly dependent on autophagy for their survival [122]. This is because neurons are post mitotic cells and are unable to dilute damaged organelles and abnormal proteins through mitosis. Thus neurons are in urgent need of efficient degradation of abnormal proteins such as A β and phosphorylated Tau proteins through the autophagic pathway [123]. Once the ALP pathway is defective and leads to a progressive accumulation of cellular waste, it will place a heavy burden on neurons [124]. Growing evidence showed that ALP dysfunction may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD. Impaired lysosomal protein degradation and excessive accumulation of autophagic vesicles were found in the brains of patients with AD and animal models of AD compared to normal brains [125,126127]; more severe  memory impairment as well as more A β aggregation and SPs formation in the brain were seen in the offspring of autophagy-deficient mice [128].\n\nALP has a dual role in AD pathogenesis [129]. In the early stage of AD, autophagy gene expression is heavily upregulated, delivering misfolded proteins (including A β and Tau proteins) from neurons to lysosomes  for  efficient  degradation,  exerting  an  initial  neuroprotective response  [130].  However,  it  has  been  reported  that  the  lysosomal degradation function has started to be significantly  impaired  by this time,  with  a  progressive  decrease  in  substrate  lysosomal  clearance [131]. As AD progresses, excessive autophagic activation beyond the lysosomal clearance capacity could lead to a massive accumulation of immature autophagosomes in neurons and impaired autophagosome-lysosome fusion, resulting in excessive organelle degradation, self-digestion, and neuronal death, thus accelerating AD pathology [130].\n\nIn the past decades, great progress has been made in the search for autophagy-lysosome modulators from TCM, providing new insights into the development of therapeutic strategies for AD targeting ALP. Tanscription  factor  EB  (TFEB)  is  a  key  transcription  factor  that  controls autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis [132]. Yang et al. [133] found that celastrol (Cel), a component of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f. (Lei Gong Teng),  could  improve  memory  impairment  and  cognitive  deficits  in P301S Tau and 3xTg-AD mice; reduce the aggregation of phosphorylated Tau protein in the brain; promote TFEB nuclear translocation; and increase the production of autophagy marker LC3B-II and decrease the expression  of  SQSTM1/p62.  These  findings  suggested  that  Cel  may promote the degradation of phosphorylated Tau proteins and enhance the  cognitive  performance  of  AD  mice  by  activating  TFEB-mediated autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis.\n\nFurthermore,  in  vitro  experiments  also  confirmed  that  Chinese medicine and its main active ingredients and derivatives, such as panax notoginseng saponins [134], β -asarone [135], and corynoxine B derivative CB6 [136], have certain autophagy-inducing and neuroprotective effects.\n\n2.5.2.1. mTOR-dependent pathway. Autophagic signals can be regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal pathway [137]. mTOR is a 289 kDa serine/threonine protein kinase in the PI3K-related protein kinase family [138]. It is present in mammals as two types of protein complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) [139]. Among them, mTORC1 is the main controller of ALP that inhibits autophagosomes formation and could regulate autophagy by modulating the activity of the ULK1 complex [140,141]. Besides, mTORC1  inhibition  could  lead  to  dephosphorylation  of  TFEB  and translocation of TFEB to the nucleus, where it binds to the promoter\n\nM.-R. Ding et al.\n\nregion  containing  the  CLEAR  (coordinated  lysosomal  expression  and regulation) sequence, thus upregulating the expression of lysosomal and autophagy-related  genes  and  promoting  lysosomal  biogenesis  and autophagy  induction  [142].  In  contrast,  mTORC2  is  insensitive  to rapamycin and has been found to regulate CMA activity in recent years [143].  Numerous  studies  have  shown  that  upregulation  of  multiple components of the mTOR signal pathway and its association with Tau pathology could be observed in the brains of patients with AD [144, 145146].\n\nRecent studies have shown that mTOR could coordinate or interact with  various  upstream  signals,  such  as  adenosine  monophosphateactivated protein kinase (AMPK), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) [147].\n\nAMPK is a heterotrimeric complex consisting of α -catalytic subunit, β -regulatory subunit, and γ -regulatory subunit [148]. AMPK is a major regulator of cellular energy metabolism and could act as a pivotal sensor of  relative  energy  status  in  the  cell  upstream  of  mTOR,  activating autophagy during low energy states with high AMP/ATP ratio [149]. Activated  AMPK  has  been  found  to  inhibit  mTOR  activity  by  phosphorylating and activating tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) function.  TSC2  is  a  GTPase-activating  protein  that  inhibits  mTORC1  by converting the RAS homologue enriched in brain (RHEB) GTPase from the  active  GTP-bound  form  to  the  inactive  GDP-bound  form  [150]. Additionally,  activated  AMPK  could  downregulate  mTOR  signal  by directly phosphorylating regulatory-associated protein of  mTOR (Raptor) [151] or directly phosphorylate ULK1, a downstream target of mTORC1,  to  enhance  autophagy  [152,153],  thereby  increasing  A β clearance, alleviating Tau pathology, and improving cognitive function. However, some studies noted that AMPK activation had non-neuroprotective properties that might lead to deleterious outcomes such as A β production and abnormal phosphorylation of Tau proteins [154].\n\nAs a regulator of a wide variety of cellular processes, GSK-3 is central to cellular metabolism and signaling processes [155]. And it is considered to be a critical regulator involved in a number of neuronal processes including axonal transport, cholinergic function, and synaptic plasticity [156]. Moreover, GSK-3, one of the negative regulators of mTORC1, could  regulate  autophagy  and  lysosomal  activity  by  phosphorylating TSC2 or directly phosphorylating Raptor at Ser859 to inhibit mTORC1 [155]. GSK-3 hyperactivity has been observed in the brains of patients with AD [157,158], and overexpression of GSK-3 has been shown to induce  AD  pathology,  cognitive  deficits,  and  gliosis  in  many  animal models of AD [159,160161162163].\n\nThe PI3K/AKT signal pathway has significant roles in the brain in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration as well as establishing neuronal polarity, regulating neurotransmission and enhancing synaptic plasticity [164]. PI3K could convert phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidyl-inositol, 3,4,5  triphosphate  by  being  activated  by  the  input  signal,  which  in turn leads to AKT activation. Activated AKT could prevent its negative regulation of Rheb  by phosphorylating TSC1/2, thus activating mTORC1 [165]. The  abnormal  and  sustained  activation  of  neuronal PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal transduction has been reported to be an early feature of AD [166]. However, another study pointed out that while inhibition of PI3K/mTOR signal pathway activated autophagy to eliminate  toxic  proteins,  activation  of  PI3K  could  promote  neuronal  cell survival [151].\n\nIncreasing  evidence  suggests  the  importance  of  mTOR-dependent autophagy in the pathogenesis of AD [167]. In-depth understanding of mTOR and its upstream signals may provide new ideas to explore the potential targets of TCM for the treatment of AD [168]. Rahman et al. [169]  found  that  oxyresveratrol  (OxyR)  reduced  the  production  of glucocorticoid-induced APP in mouse cortical astrocytes; increased the number of LC-3 puncta formation and LC3-II protein expression levels; increased  the  expression  of  p-AMPK,  p-ULK1  (Ser757),  and  p-ULK1 (Ser555) proteins; and suppressed the expression of mTOR downstream phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (Ser240/244). These findings suggested that OxyR could activate autophagy by regulating the AMPK/ULK1/mTOR signal pathway, thereby reducing APP production in mouse cortical astrocytes and exerting anti-neurotoxic effects.\n\nP . tenuifolia Willd.  (Yuan  Zhi)  has  been  widely  used  in  clinical treatment  of  insomnia,  cognitive  decline,  and  neurasthenia  [170]. Studies have shown that it may induce autophagy through upregulation of AMPK/mTOR signal pathway, thus inhibiting the aggregation of A β and acting anti-AD effects [171]. Huang et al. [172] explored the neuroprotective  effects  of  galangin  (GA)  on  okadaic  acid  (OA)-induced PC12 cell injury. The results showed that GA treatment significantly increased OA-induced PC12 cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner; decreased the levels of p-Tau, A β 42, and β -secretase; increased the expression of p-Akt and p-mTOR; and attenuated the expression of p-GSK3 β and Beclin-1.  These  findings  suggested  that  GA  could  exert certain  neuroprotective  effects  by  regulating  the  Akt/GSK3 β /mTOR-dependent autophagic pathway.\n\nCurcumin (CUR) is the main polyphenol contained in Curcuma longa L.(Jiang Huang) [173]. Wang et al. [174] found that CUR could induce autophagy  through  downregulation  of  the  PI3K/Akt/mTOR  signal pathway, thus reducing the production of A β and improving cognitive impairment. Such effects correspond to the manifestations of excessive activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal pathway and reduced autophagy observed  in  the  brains  of  patients  with  advanced  AD  [175].  These findings suggested that Chinese herbs and their active ingredients may exert anti-AD effects by inducing autophagy to protect neurons.\n\nInterestingly, other studies have indicated that upregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR  signal  pathway  could  show  neuroprotective  effects under  certain  circumstances.  For  example,  Deng  et  al.  [176]  used β -asarone, the active ingredient of Acorus tatarinowii Schott (Shi Chang Pu), to intervene in APP/PS1 mice and found that compared with the untreated  group,  the  treated  group  showed  increased  expression  of p-mTOR and p62 and decreased expression of p-Akt, Beclin-1, and LC3B. In  addition,  their  learning  and  memory  ability  was  significantly improved, suggesting that β -asarone could improve the cognitive ability of  AD  mice  by  upregulating  the  PI3K/Akt/mTOR  signal  pathway  to inhibit Beclin-1-dependent autophagy. In-vitro studies have also demonstrated  that β -asarone  attenuated  A β 1 -42-induced  neuronal toxicity  by  activating  the  Akt/mTOR  signal  pathway  to  attenuate autophagy [177].\n\nThe above studies suggested that the potential pathways regulating mTOR-dependent  autophagy  are  intricate  and  complex.  Therefore, clinical treatment of AD should pay due attention to the central role of the mTOR signal pathway in ALP regulation, while dynamically coordinating the balance between mTOR and its upstream signals. Compared with simple mTOR inhibitors or agonists, the advantage of TCM is that it can  play  a  synergistic  role  between  drugs,  or  can  play  a  role  in dynamically  regulating  mTOR  and  its  related  signal  pathways  and autophagic activity, which is more in line with the rule of AD pathological transformation.\n\n2.5.2.2. mTOR-independent signal  pathway. Although current research on autophagy-related signal pathways has been mainly focused on the classical mTOR signal pathway, autophagy could also be regulated by other mTOR-independent signal pathways, such as the silent information-regulated transcription factor 1 (SIRT1) signal pathway and the  peroxisome proliferator activated receptor  alpha  (PPARα )  signal pathway [178].\n\nSIRT1,  a  nicotinamide  adenosine  dinucleotide-dependent  class-III protein deacetylase, is widely expressed in the brain and is involved in regulating important processes such as neurogenesis, neuroprotection, synaptic plasticity, and memory formation [179]. SIRT1 expression has been reported to be significantly downregulated in the brains of patients with AD [180]. In vivo experiments showed that inhibition or knockdown of SIRT1 exacerbated synaptic loss and impaired the ability of\n\nM.-R.

In contrast, overexpression of SIRT1 reduced A β aggregation, promoted Tau protein deacetylation and improved Tau pathological propagation, thus improving cognitive function and reducing mortality [183,184]. In addition, SIRT1 has an important role in autophagy regulation and could activate autophagy through deacetylation of some Atg proteins [185]. From these, it is clear that SIRT1 is closely related to autophagy regulation  and  AD progression.\n\nPPAR α ,  PPAR δ ,  and  PPAR γ are transcription factors that regulate gene expression upon ligand activation [186]. Among them, PPAR α is responsible for  the  regulation of  cellular  metabolism  and  energy  homeostasis [187], including the fatty acid β -oxidation pathway, glucose metabolism,  and  glutamatergic  and  cholinergic/dopaminergic  neurotransmission in the brain [188]. Cumulative evidence suggested strong association between PPAR α and AD. For instance, PPAR α -null mice were found to have deficits in spatial learning and memory abilities [189]. Moreover,  activation  of  PPAR α -mediated  autophagy  and  lysosomal pathway  could  inhibit  the  accumulation  of  A β in  hippocampal  and cortical tissues of APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice and ameliorate their spatial learning deficits, memory deficits, and anxiety symptoms [190], suggesting that PPAR α is required for the maintenance of normal cognitive performance [191]. In addition, it has been reported that PPAR α could induce the expression of ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10) in the brain of flag-TFEB transgenic mice in an autophagy-dependent manner  and  stimulate  APP  processing  toward  the  alpha-secretase pathway, thus increasing soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha production  and  reducing  c-terminal  fragmentβ (CTFβ )  level,  thereby exerting definite neuroprotective effects [192].\n\nResveratrol (RSV) is a natural phenolic compound widely found in Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et Zucc. (Hu Zhang), Morus alba L. (Sang Bai Pi), Magnolia officinalis Rehd. Et Wils. (Hou Po), and other Chinese herbs [193].  Recent  studies  have  identified  RSV  as  a  natural  autophagy modulator against AD [194], which could inhibit inflammatory cytokine release,  modulate  mitochondrial  function,  reduce  A β deposition,  and improve impaired cognitive performance [195 -197]. RSV was found to inhibit the A β 25 -35-induced decrease in viability of PC12 cells; upregulate  LC3-II  expression;  promote  autophagosome  formation  and  p62\n\ndegradation; and increase the expression of SIRT1, auto-poly-ADP-ribosylation of poly polymerase 1 (PARP1), and tyrosyl transfer-RNA  synthetase  (TyrRS)  proteins  [198].  These  findings  suggested  that  RSV  may  induce  autophagy  through  activation  of  the TyrRS-PARP1-SIRT1 signal pathway, thus attenuating A β 25 -35-induced neurotoxicity. Furthermore, Yang et al. [199] found that fisetin could attenuate Pb-induced synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment by regulating AMPK/SIRT1 signal pathway and autophagy pathway.\n\nIyaswamy et al. [200] found that Cynanchum otophyllum Schneid. (Qing Yang Shen, QYS) could significantly improve spatial memory and learning ability in 3xTg-AD mice; reduce the accumulation of insoluble A β aggregates and phosphorylated Tau aggregates; downregulate the expression of APP, CTF, p-APP, p-CTF, and Sarcosyl-insoluble fractions of phosphorylated Tau proteins (PHF1, CP13, MC1, AT8, and HT7); and increase expression levels of PPAR α , TFEB, LC3B-II, LAMP1, and mature CTSD. These findings suggested that QYS could promote ALP through activation of the PPAR α -TFEB signal pathway, thus alleviating AD pathology and promoting recovery of cognitive function. In addition, in 5XFAD mice, cinnamic acid also could activate PPAR α ,  upregulate TFEB, and increase lysosome biosynthesis, thus inhibiting the production of SPs and improving memory function in AD mice [201].",

        "content": "Intracellular signal pathways mediate significant events in cellular life  cycle,  and  they  are  closely  associated  with  AD  development. Simultaneously, during the evolution of organisms, complex and close connections  have  been  established  between  major  signal  pathways [202]. In the present study, the action mechanisms and potentials of TCM against AD were synthesized and summarized from the perspective of signal pathways (Tables 1 and 2). Chinese herbs could regulate signal pathways related to AD pathological progression, such as NFκ B, Nrf2, JAK/STAT, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, autophagy-lysosome pathway-related AMPK/mTOR, GSK-3/mTOR, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR, as well as SIRT1 and PPAR α pathway. They could regulate crosstalk between pathways  through  multitarget  synergy,  thus  maintaining  chronic  inflammatory  interaction  balance,  inhibiting  oxidative  stress  damage,\n\nM.-R.

Ding et al.\n\nFig. 1. Potential targets of TCM for treating AD. TCM could regulate signal pathways related to AD pathological progression, including NFκ B, Nrf2, JAK/STAT, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, autophagy-lysosome pathway-related AMPK/mTOR, GSK-3/mTOR, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR, as well as SIRT1 and PPAR α pathway. These signal pathways involved in A β deposition, Tau protein hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, protein degradation and autophagy. TCM are therefore alleviating the AD progression and improving cognitive impairment. This figure was created with BioRender (https://biorender.com/).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nregulating  ubiquitin-proteasome  system  function,  modulating  autophagy, and ultimately improving cognitive impairment in patients with AD (Fig. 1). Considering the complexity of AD pathological mechanisms, TCM with multilevel and multitarget potential may become a breakthrough  for  AD  therapeutic  drug  development.  The  prospects  for exploring and developing potential novel anti-AD drugs from TCM and its active ingredients are broad. Besides, signal pathways such as HIPPO [203] and Notch [204] are closely related to delaying AD development. However, relatively few studies have reported on the prevention and treatment of AD through these pathways, and this could be one of the directions  to  be  further  explored  in  the  future.  To  sum  up,  future research  on  the  prevention  and  treatment  of  AD  in  TCM  should  be carried out in depth to provide new ideas for exploring the pathogenesis of AD and screening potential targets for the treatment of AD, and to lay a certain foundation for further development of novel AD therapeutic drugs.",

        "content": "Purpose of Review Nutrition is known to modulate the immune system and may alter neuroinflammatory processes implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer ' s disease (AD) and progression of neurodegeneration. Here, we review the evidence for healthy dietary patterns and age-related cognition and discuss potential neuroinflammatory actions of diet on cognitive function.\n\nRecent Findings Anti-inflammatory dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet (MD) and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) may be neuroprotective. Several dietary components consumed in the MD and DASH (omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants and polyphenols) can inhibit neuroinflammation associated with AD. Anti-inflammatory diets may also attenuate neuroinflammation via indirect immune pathways from the gut microbiome and systemic circulation.\n\nSummary Diet may influence cognitive ageing via several inflammatory pathways. However, data from human studies are lacking and the exact mechanisms linking diet to cognitive function remain elusive. Further dietary intervention studies are required to investigate diet-associated neurological change from the earliest through to latest stages of cognitive decline. Furthermore, incorporation of neuroimaging measures in intervention studies would advance current understanding of the mechanistic effects of dietary modification on neuroinflammation in the ageing brain.\n\nKeywords Inflammation .

        "content": "Worldwide, 50 million people are living with Alzheimer ' s disease (AD) and related dementias, and this figure is projected to triple by 2050 unless preventive measures are developed [1]. Addressing modifiable risk factors is considered to be the most promising strategy to prevent AD [1]. In this regard, increasing evidence suggests that dietary interventions have potential to protect against cognitive decline during ageing [2 -4].\n\nThis article is part of the Topical Collection on Nutrition and Aging\n\n* Claire T. McEvoy c.mcevoy@qub.ac.uk\n\n1 Institute of Health and Society and Newcastle University Institute of Ageing, Newcastle University, Biomedical Research Building, Campus of Ageing and Vitality, Newcastle upon Tyne NE4 5PL, UK\n\n2 Centre for Public Health, Queen ' s University Belfast, Grosvenor Road, Belfast, Northern Ireland BT12 6BJ, UK\n\nThe mechanisms governing dietary influences on cognition are not clear, but inflammatory pathways are likely to be involved [5, 6]. Inflammation has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of AD [7 ·· , 8]. Microglial macrophages in the brain become chronically activated during ageing [9], and particularly under pathological conditions [10], to promote sustained production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1 β , interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factorα (TNFα ) [8, 11]. Production of these molecules can perpetuate a cycle of neuroinflammatory processes including amyloidosis, neuronal death [10, 12], cortical thinning [13, 14], reduced brain volume [13], cerebral vascular diseaserelated events such as microbleeds and infarcts [15, 16] and neurodegeneration [7 ·· ]. Genetic studies provide strong evidence for a causative role of neuroinflammation in AD, with several mutations in microglial genes, for example, TREM2 and CD33, being independently associated with elevated AD risk [17]. Furthermore, greater numbers of activated microglial cells and cytokines have been confirmed in brain tissue from individuals with AD [18].\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDiet is known to modulate the immune system [19 ·· ], and several nutrients and bioactive components can influence neuroinflammatory processes in animals. For example, polyphenols, unsaturated fats and antioxidant vitamins inhibit oxidative stress and neuroinflammation [20, 21 ·· , 22], while saturated fat promotes inflammation, particularly in the hypothalamus [23]. However, it is not clear whether diet-induced effects on neurocognition are mediated directly by neuroinflammatory processes and/or via other immune mechanisms in vivo. An increasing body of evidence suggests that peripheral inflammation and alterations to the gut microbiome can amplify neuroinflammation and accelerate neurodegeneration [7 ·· , 24, 25] and these external factors can also be influenced by diet [26].\n\nMechanistic studies in the brain have primarily focused on single nutrients. However, the synergistic effects of nutrients and foods when consumed together as a usual dietary pattern are likely to exert greater effects on inflammatory processes and neurodegeneration during ageing [25, 27]. There has been much interest in examining the Mediterranean diet (MD) and dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) dietary patterns as potential strategies for dementia prevention due to their proven anti-inflammatory [28 -30] and cardioprotective effects [31, 32]. The MD and DASH have shown promising associations with slower rate of cognitive decline [33, 34] and reduced AD risk [35 -38] although results have not been consistent [39, 40] and evidence for a causal relationship is limited due to the small number of diet intervention studies conducted. Interestingly, more recent neuroimaging studies have shown protective effects of MD on neuronal structures and early morphological changes linked to neurodegeneration and AD [41 -48].\n\nThis review aims to summarise available evidence to evaluate the role of MD and DASH dietary patterns for cognitive health and AD risk during ageing and discuss underlying inflammatory mechanisms of diet on cognitive function in humans and animal models.",

        "content": "The MD describes the traditional dietary pattern consumed in Mediterranean countries and is characterised by high intake of fruits, vegetables, wholegrains, nuts and legumes; moderate intake of fish, poultry and alcohol (particularly red wine, with meals) and low intake of red and processed meats with olive oil used as the main fat source [49, 50]. Adherence to the MD has demonstrated clear benefits for both primary [32] and secondary [51] CVD prevention. This may also be the case for cognitive function. A recent pooled analysis of available\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprospective data in older adults reported a beneficial association between adherence to the MD and cognitive function, especially for domains of global cognition and episodic memory [52].\n\nObservational studies that have evaluated the MD for cognitive health are summarised in Table 1. In summary, greater concordance to the MD has been associated with better cognitive performance [53, 54, 57, 58, 65], slower rate of cognitive decline [61, 66 -68] and reduced risk of cognitive impairment [53, 55, 56, 61] and AD [36]. However, the variable and sometimes disparate study findings [27, 59, 60, 62 -64] are likely due to differences between studies in the populations investigated and methods used to assess diet and cognition. Most epidemiologic studies have examined MD adherence using a score system derived from population-specific median reported intake thresholds for each individual food component in the MD score and this approach limits the comparability of findings with other populations [53]. Furthermore, there is heterogeneity between studies with regards to the cognitive outcomes measured, follow-up time and population characteristics including baseline cognitive status.\n\nIt is possible that MD contributes to neuronal integrity across the life-course. Emerging evidence from observational studies report a link between greater MD adherence and more favourable brain structures and functions that protect against neurodegeneration including increased cortical thickness [45, 48], greater brain volumes [42], slower rate of hippocampal atrophy and improved structural connectivity [43, 44, 46] as well as less amyloid (A β ) accumulation at both midlife and older age [41, 47].\n\nThe effect of MD on neurocognition has been evaluated in a limited number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The PREDIMED study demonstrated a modest beneficial effect of increased MD adherence over 4 -6 years on cognitive function in cognitively healthy adults at high CVD risk [2, 4, 71] particularly in domains of global cognition, memory and executive function [4]. In contrast, adopting a MD over 6 months had no effect on cognitive function in healthy older Australian adults [72]. The recent NU-AGE trial also reported no benefit of a Mediterranean-style diet on cognitive function after 1 year in older European adults; however, participants with greatest MD adherence demonstrated improved global cognition and episodic memory compared to those with low adherence [73].",

        "content": "The DASH diet is an accepted non-pharmacological treatment for hypertension [31] and, like the MD, recommends a high intake of fruits, vegetables, nuts and wholegrain products. However, in contrast to a MD, DASH places greater emphasis on low fat dairy foods, low dietary sodium and does not recommend alcohol. In older adults, higher DASH scores have been associated with better cognitive function [69] and slower\n\nTable 1 An overview of studies associated with anti-inflammatory dietary patterns\n\n| Key findings               | MDadherence was positively associated with better MMSE score among men only. For women, an inverse association was detected. Low MDadherence was associated with poorer performance in one measure of attention, processing speed, and working memory. Compared to those with the lowest MDadherence, those at the highest MDadherence had a 28% less risk of developing MCI and a 48% less risk of developing AD.   | One unit increase in MDscore was associated with 13 - 19%lower odds of MCI, and 19 - 26% lower odds of AD. Agreater MDadherence was associated with better cognitive function among both cohorts.                                                                          | Greater MDadherence was associated with better cognitive function.

Higher MDscore was associated with larger frontal, parietal, occipital thickness and average lobar cortical thickness. Higher MDscore was associated with fewer MMSE errors, but not with other cognitive test scores. MDadherence was not associated with the risk for incident dementia.   |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cognitive outcome measures | MMSE <24 or ≥ 24 Episodic memory, lexical- semantic memory, short term and working memory, mental flexibility Incidence of MCI and progression from MCI to AD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Mini-Mental State Examination, Logical, Memory II (WMS;

There is limited evidence from intervention studies for an effect of DASH on neurocognition. The ENCORE study showed improved cognitive function in response to a calorie restricted DASH diet among overweight adults with hypertension [3], while preliminary 6-month data from the ENLIGHTEN study in cognitively impaired adults demonstrated no benefit of DASH diet alone on cognition, but improvement in executive function among those consuming DASH combined with aerobic exercise [74].\n\nCollectively, the available evidence suggests that MD and DASH patterns may provide protection against neurodegeneration during ageing, with more consistent associations in favour of the MD, probably owing to a greater number of studies that have examined MD and cognition, relative to DASH or indeed other dietary patterns. Further prospective studies in diverse populations are recommended to determine relations between dietary patterns and clinically relevant measures of cognitive decline as well as incident AD. While few dietary intervention studies have been conducted, beneficial effects of MD on cognition are shown in trials of longer duration (12 months or more) [2, 4, 60] and in participants who adhere more closely to the intervention diet [63]. Further research is required to determine the duration of dietary intervention needed for optimal effect on cognition and to identify cognitive end-point measures that can respond to subtle dietinduced changes in the ageing brain. Furthermore, intervention strategies would benefit from learning how best to support behaviour change towards a healthy dietary pattern in different population groups.\n\nThe MD and DASH dietary patterns are typically low in saturated fat, sugar and high in antioxidants, fibres and polyphenols, which have potential independent effects on brain health. It is likely that the myriad of bioactive compounds and nutrients consumed at synergistic levels within these dietary patterns exert the potential to reduce neuroinflammatory processes involved in neurodegeneration [75].",

        "content": "Nutrients have important physiological roles for normal brain functioning and are transported into the brain via the blood -brain barrier (BBB) or from the choroid plexus transport locus of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier by distinct mechanisms, such as facilitated diffusion and active transport [76]. The effect of whole dietary patterns on neuroinflammation is yet to be discerned; however, animal studies have consistently reported anti-neuroinflammatory effects of several nutrients typically eaten in high amounts in MD and DASH diets.\n\nAntioxidants from fruit and vegetables suppress neuroinflammatory processes and neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting free radicals and cytokine production in activated microglia cells [22, 75, 77] and plant-derived flavonoids are thought to play a role in preventing neuroinflammation by downregulating transcription factor activity, e.g. NF-KB and inhibiting pro-inflammatory cell signalling pathways [78, 79]. Long chain omega-3 fatty acids from fish attenuate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in microglia and help to resolve inflammation in the brain [20, 80].\n\nWhile these animal studies provide important insights into mechanistic actions of diet on neuroinflammation, it is not clear how well the findings translate to humans, due to potential differences in nutrient bioavailability and metabolism. Indeed, single nutrient supplementation has shown no cognitive benefit among older adults in the few trials that have been conducted so far [81 · , 82 · ], although positive signals have been observed for individuals with low baseline nutrient status [83] and for fish oil supplementation in early cognitive impairment [84], suggesting that population subgroups may derive cognitive benefit from nutrient supplementation.",

        "content": "Increased peripheral inflammatory markers have been associated with neurodegeneration [85] and are suggested to increase neuroinflammation via neuronal and hormonal pathways, as previously reviewed [7 ·· , 19 ·· ]. The MD and DASH diet have demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects in humans. In a recent meta-analysis of six RCTs, DASH significantly decreased serum (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentration (mean difference -1.01: 95% CI -1.64, -0.38; I 2 = 67.7%) compared to usual diet which tended to be of greater magnitude in trials with longer duration [30]. The MD has been shown to decrease a broader range of inflammatory biomarkers. The PREDIMED study reported reductions in cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p70, CRP, TNFα ) and chemokines (MCP-1 and macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIP-1 β )) in response to a 3-month MD supplemented with either olive oil or nuts, and the anti-inflammatory effects were observed up to 5 years of intervention [28, 29]. Adoption of a MD also significantly reduced hs-CRP, IL-6, IL-7, and IL-18 in patients with the metabolic syndrome [86]. Furthermore, key components of the MD, such as oily fish and omega 3 fatty acids, as well as bioactive polyphenols found in fruits and vegetables, red wine and olive oil have also been shown to reduce pro-inflammatory markers [78, 87, 88 ·· ]. Hence, the ability of dietary patterns, particularly the MD, to decrease systemic inflammation may help to attenuate neuroinflammation.\n\nEmerging observational data lend support to systemic inflammation as a driver between diet and neurocognition (Table 2). High pro-inflammatory dietary scores have been linked with poor cognitive performance [91, 94] and cognitive impairment [92, 93]. Moreover, a proinflammatory dietary pattern, based on circulating IL-6 and characterised by higher intake of red meat, processed meat, peas and legumes, and fried food, and lower intake of whole grains has been associated with accelerated cognitive decline [89], while an inflammatory nutrient pattern derived from IL-6 and CRP levels and characterised by low intake of calcium, antioxidant vitamins, omega-3 and high intake of cholesterol, has been inversely associated with brain volume and cognitive function [90]. Further longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate whether dietary patterns based on systemic inflammatory biomarkers are related to incident AD.",

        "content": "The human gut microbiome represents the collective genomes of 10 -100 trillion microorganisms harboured in the gastrointestinal tract and is considered important for healthy immune function [95]. The ageing process and other environmental factors can result in alterations to the microbiome composition (dysbiosis) and contribute to the development of chronic lowgrade inflammation [96]. Dysbiosis stimulates excretion of endotoxins, e.g. lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and microbial amyloids to promote permeability of the gut wall and increase peripheral circulation of proinflammatory cytokines [97]. Dybiosis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD by initiating and prolonging neuroinflammatory processes. Gutderived bacteria and toxins can compromise the integrity of the BBB and contribute to early neuroinflammatory changes and AD by priming microglia and impairing amyloid clearance [24, 25]. Moreover, circulating LPSs and microbial amyloid activate innate resistance receptors, e.g. toll-like receptor (TLR) and receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) to amplify pro-inflammatory signalling and promote chronic neuroinflammation and progress neurodegeneration, particularly in brain regions sensitive to AD such as the hippocampus [25, 98].\n\nAlmost 60% of variation in the gut microbiome is attributable to diet [99]; therefore, modulating the gut microbiome through dietary means could be an effective approach to reduce inflammation associated with AD. However, only few studies have evaluated dietary patterns and gut microbiota. Preliminary data has shown positive associations between the MD and increased number of beneficial microbiota species, e.g. Bacteroidetes and their short chain fatty acid metabolites [100, 101] that have anti-inflammatory effects [26]. Further research is needed to understand the complex relationships between the gut microbiome and cognitive health and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 2 An overview of studies associated with pro-inflammatory dietary patterns\n\n| Key findings               | A greater decline in reasoning was seen in participants in the highest tertile of adherence to the inflammatory dietary pattern compared to those in the lowest tertile after adjustment for confounding variables.

        "content": "Given the lack of effective treatments and projected increased prevalence of AD, there is considerable interest in understanding the contribution of neuroinflammation to the pathogenesis of AD in order to develop effective preventive strategies for cognitive decline.\n\nCompelling evidence shows that nutrients and other bioactive dietary compounds influence neuroinflammatory processes leading to neurodegeneration in animals and that nutrients can act synergistically to exert greater biological effects. It is plausible that diets rich in anti-inflammatory components attenuate neuroinflammation via several immune pathways within the brain and indirectly from the gut microbiome and systemic circulation. However, data from human studies are lacking and the exact inflammatory mechanisms linking diet to cognitive function remain elusive.\n\nGrowing evidence supports a protective effect of antiinflammatory dietary patterns, especially the MD, against cognitive decline in older persons but causal associations between diet and AD remain uncertain. The evidence base has been recently strengthened by small intervention studies showing improvements in cognitive function in response to MD and calorie-controlled DASH. However, adequately powered intervention studies with larger sample sizes and longer durations are required to examine the effect of dietary modification on clinically relevant cognitive outcomes. Neuroimaging studies have shown direct beneficial associations of MD on preclinical changes associated with AD; therefore, brain biomarkers should be considered as end-points in future intervention studies to investigate diet-associated neurological change from the earliest through to latest stages of cognitive decline. Furthermore, incorporation of PET (positron emission tomography) could allow measurement of in vivo microglia activation [102] and advance current understanding of the mechanistic effects of dietary modification on neuroinflammation in the ageing brain.\n\nWhile most research attention has been given to MD and DASH,there is still much to learn about the ideal combination of foods and nutrients for optimal cognitive health during ageing. More recently, the MIND (Mediterranean-DASH diet intervention for neurodegeneration delay) dietary pattern that incorporates foods based on evidence in the diet-dementia field has shown to be more predictive of cognitive decline than the MD [103] and has also been associated with reduced AD risk [104]. The effect of MIND on cognitive decline is currently being evaluated in several US trials (e.g. clinicaltrials.gov Reference NCT02817074, NCT03688126) and will generate valuable data to determine whether improving diet quality is an effective strategy to improve brain health in older adults.\n\nFunding This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust [Grant Ref 202097/Z/16/Z].",

Current AD treatments aim to relieve symptoms and slow disease progression, but a cure is elusive due to limited understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms.\n\nMain content Stem cell technology has the potential to revolutionize AD research. With the ability to self-renew and differentiate into various cell types, stem cells are valuable tools for disease modeling, drug screening, and cell therapy. Recent advances have broadened our understanding beyond the deposition of amyloidβ (Aβ) or tau proteins in AD to encompass risk genes, immune system disorders, and neuron-glia mis-communication, relying heavily on stem cell-derived disease models. These stem cell-based models (e.g., organoids and microfluidic chips) simulate in vivo pathological processes with extraordinary spatial and temporal resolution. Stem cell technologies have the potential to alleviate AD pathology through various pathways, including immunomodulation, replacement of damaged neurons, and neurotrophic support. In recent years, transplantation of glial cells like oligodendrocytes and the infusion of exosomes have become hot research topics.\n\nConclusion Although stem cell-based models and therapies for AD face several challenges, such as extended culture time and low differentiation efficiency, they still show considerable potential for AD treatment and are likely to become preferred tools for AD research.\n\nKeywords Alzheimer's disease, Stem cell technology, Disease modeling, Pathogenesis, Neuron-glia interaction, Stem cell-derived therapy",

        "content": "Alzheimer's  disease  (AD)  is  a  common,  chronic  neurodegenerative  disorder  characterized  by  the  extensive distribution of neuronal tangles and amyloid plaques in the  brain  along  with  astrogliosis,  neuroinflammation, synaptotoxicity,  neuronal  loss,  and  vascular  alterations [28]. In recent decades, AD has been a subject of intensive  research,  however,  no  cure  has  been  developed  to date due to a limited understanding of AD pathogenesis. Fortunately, stem cells-as a category of cells with multidirectional  differentiation  potential-present  new  and powerful tools for AD disease modeling, drug screening, and cell therapy.\n\nThe  conventional  animal  models  used  to  study  AD, which  is  mainly  constructed  through  transgenesis  or\n\n† Zimeng Cao, Fanshu Kong and Jiaqi Ding contributed  equally  to  this  work  and  should  be  considered  co-\n\nfirst  authors.\n\n*Correspondence:\n\nChunxia Chen\n\nchenchx36@mail2.sysu.edu.cn\n\nFumei He\n\nhefm@mail3.sysu.edu.cn\n\nWenbin Deng\n\ndengwb5@mail.sysu.edu.cn\n\n1 School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shenzhen Campus of Sun Yat-Sen University, Shenzhen 518107, China\n\n2 School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Dali University, Dali 671000, China\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n© The Author(s) 2024.

Stem cell-based models show significant  potential  for  solving  these  problems.  By  reprogramming donor somatic cells with disease morphology, one  can  obtain  induced  pluripotent  stem  cells  (iPSCs) with the ability to expand and differentiate, thereby freeing researchers from reliance on animal models. Moreover,  the  ability  to  culture  3D  iPSC-based  organoids  and construct humanized AD models has enabled researchers to  explore  other  possible  factors  related  to  pathogenesis,  such  as  immune  system  disorders,  impaired  synapses,  abnormal  mitochondrial  structure  and  function, and  mutations  in  risk  genes  (Figure  1).  As  the  amyloid hypothesis continues to be investigated [99], understanding  the  contributions  of  these  pathological  phenomena to disease etiology and neuronal death is of great importance for understanding AD pathogenesis and developing new therapies.\n\nThe development of stem cell modeling technology has also launched a new era of personalized pharmaceuticals. Current  drug  screening  methods  are  expensive,  timeconsuming, and complicated. In contrast, stem cell-based models  can  accurately  simulate  pathological  changes in  the  AD  brain,  providing  more  possibilities  for  ADrelated  drug  screening.  Using  stem  cell  technology,  we can understand the effects of drugs at the earliest stage of analytical development and testing and make accurate assessments of their side effects and efficacy.\n\nCurrently, Aβ and tau pathologies remain the focus of new  therapies  undergoing  clinical  trials  for  AD,  which include monoclonal antibodies targeting Aβ[50, 88, 109, 131],  the  β-secretase  (BACE1)  inhibitor  that  inhibits secretase activity to lessen Aβ deposition [35], and drugs that target tau protein [94]. Unfortunately, most clinical trials have not achieved good results and some have been terminated due to serious side effects [193]. Such cases demonstrate  the challenges of sub-cellular therapies while highlighting the advantages of stem cell therapies, such as the possibility of reversing the entire pathological process  of  AD  [136,  142].  Transplantation  of  stem  cells in animal models has been shown to provide significant benefits  by  affecting  multiple  pathological  mechanisms and  ultimately  improving  cognitive  function  [103].  Targeting  ganglion  stem  cells  in  the  body  to  activate  and generate new glial cells or neurons is another strategy for stem cell therapy. New targets have been recently identified in animal models to produce these pro-regenerative effects [77].\n\nHowever, the heterogeneity of stem cells and their survival and migration rates after transplantation limit their applications. Researchers have attempted to address these  issues  through  methods  like  modifying  stem  cell encapsulation, pretreatment, or co-delivery. Alternatively,  direct  use  of  stem  cell-derived  exosomes  for  AD treatment may achieve better results than various complex stem cell modification methods [128], as they show significantly improved pathology and cognitive function in  preclinical  experiments.  Their  therapeutic  potential may  be  even  further  exploited  after  engineering.  For example,  the  production  of  exosomes  can  be  increased by  3D  culture  or  co-culture  with  chloroquine,  NH4Cl, and  other  molecules.  Also,  by  changing  the  content  of oxygen, hydrogen ions, and nutrients in stem cell culture medium,  the  release  of  exosomes  can  be  altered,  however, this may require exploration through further experiments.  Fusion  of  protein  sequences  or  peptides  with exosome membranes can also be used to build devices for targeted delivery, and electroporation is the most widely used method for membrane fusion [181].\n\nIn  this  review,  we  summarize  progress  in  stem  cellderived AD models and the principles and applications of stem cells and derived therapies to alleviate AD pathology. We then discuss the prospects of stem cells as models for further investigation of AD pathogenesis and drug screening, as well as application prospects and development directions for stem cells and derived therapies targeting AD.",

        "content": "Stem cells are a category of cells with the potential of selfrenewal and multidirectional differentiation. They originate from various tissues such as placenta, adipose tissue, and  dental  pulp  and  have  numerous  potentially  useful  functions such as tissue and organ regeneration and treatment of diseases (especially severe diseases).\n\nOne crucial application of stem cells in AD research is the creation of patient-derived human cellular models.  Examples  of  these  are  organoids  and  assembled spheroids, which are multicellular models composed of different brain cell types. These models can be used to test the impact of genetic, chemical, and environmental factors on AD, as well as to evaluate new genetic engineering and genome editing techniques to unravel disease  pathogenesis.  Another  area  where  stem  cells  are used  is  the  development  of  in  vivo  models  that  more accurately  reflect  human  physiology  and  disease,  such as  humanized  animal  models.  As  transplanted  stem cells or their derived tissues/organs retain their original features and functions, humanized models constructed by  transplanting  stem  cells  of  human  origin  into  animals  can  circumvent  ethical constraints associated with human experimentation [164]. Utilizing information on AD-related risk genes, biological processes and pathways, and biomarkers provided by advanced multiomics  technologies,  such  as single-cell and  spatial\n\nFig. 1 Possible pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. A Amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by BACE1 and other enzymes in the amyloid pathogenic pathway to form different isoforms of Aβ (this process can also be affected by gene mutations), which rapidly aggregate to form neurotoxic oligomers that can induce synaptic loss and further cause cognitive impairment and dementia. Simultaneously, Aβ can contribute to tau pathology by increasing abnormal phosphorylation and the formation of toxic neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which can lead to neurodegeneration. According to the synaptic defect hypothesis, synaptic damage is the underlying cause of AD and defective synapses may lead to the formation of neurotoxic Aβ. B One potential mechanism of AD progression is dysregulation of multiple metabolic pathways. Microglia glucose metabolism disruption promotes a vicious cycle of \"glycolysis-histone lactation-PKM2\", leading to an imbalance of microglia homeostasis and neuroinflammation. Astrocyte metabolic failure also impairs the neurotransmitter glutamate/GABA glutamine cycle and causes synaptic dysfunction. C Dysfunctional mitochondrial dynamics can result in aberrant mitochondrial fusion fission, in turn causing synaptic degeneration and neuronal injury. Such dynamics include diminished expression of the proteins that control this process. By transferring healthy mitochondria, astrocytes could reduce the negative effects of damaged mitochondria on neurons. This function is blocked in chronic inflammatory situations, which may hasten AD progression. The removal of Aβ and emergence of tau disease may also be impacted by aberrant mitochondrial autophagy. D Microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes have pro-inflammatory phenotypes that promote neuroinflammation and the development of AD. The three types of glial cells interact with one another to speed up neuroinflammation. For example, activated microglia secrete IL-1a, TNF-a, and C1q, which cause reactive astrocytes to develop into the A1 neurotoxic phenotype, whereas oligodendrocytes cause astrocytes to develop into the NF-B signaling or A1 phenotype. Other harmful processes in AD include the attack of Aβ on its own neuronal cell membranes and bacterial-viral infection. E Mutations in common risk genes, including APOE, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), CLU, and CD33, may disrupt normal functions-particularly lipid metabolism in glial cells-thereby increasing the risk of AD development\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntranscriptomics, long-range sequencing, next-generation  proteomics,  and  other  high-throughput  cellular phenotyping platforms, stem-cell-derived disease models can provide comprehensive insights into the pathogenesis,  progression,  and  drug  screening  of  AD  [182, 185, 186, 194, 196, 199].",

        "content": "The in vitro model of human iPSCs was first established in 2007 in the laboratory of Prof. Shinya Yamanaka [125]. More  than  a  decade  later,  iPSCs  have  been  differentiated into various pathogenic cell types including neurons and  glial  cells  to  mimic  central  nervous  system  (CNS)\n\ndevelopmental processes and profile disease phenotypes. To  promote  the  differentiation  of  iPSCs  into  the  above cell types in 2D culture and prohibit their differentiation to mesoderm or endoderm, dual TGF-β (SMAD) inhibition is utilized to generate neural stem cells (NSCs) with higher purity [19]. By inhibiting the expression of sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling through enhanced Wnt signaling, [66, 129], NSCs can develop into cortical neurons. Cortical neurons, such as cortical glutamatergic neurons, are  mainly  distributed  in  the  neocortex  and  hippocampus, which are early affected tissues in AD [78]. By further  manipulating  extrinsic  signaling  conditions,  NSCs can differentiate into other disease-related cell types such as  cholinergic  neurons  [11].  Substantial  loss  of  cholinergic  neurons has been observed in the brains of earlystage  AD  patients.  After  prolonged  culture,  neurogenic cultures can undergo gliogenesis conversion to produce various glial cells [18, 42]. Dysfunction of such glial cells is  also  considered a cause of AD pathology. As a result, it is increasingly important to study interactions between various neuronal subtypes and glial cells using such models.  Moreover,  compared  to  using  human-derived  stem cells  of  limited  origin  or  rodent  cell  lines  from  widely varying species, 2D co-culture systems using iPSCs yield highly scalable cell models that enable rapid exploration of cellular pathophysiology,  including  transcriptional, genetic, and signaling pathways [136, 142].",

        "content": "To solve the problem of simulating AD pathology in vivo, 3D  neuronal  culture  technology,  has  been  developed based on 2D cell culture systems. Unlike traditional 2D cultures, 3D neuronal cultures better simulate the natural  environment  for  cell  survival  in  organisms,  thereby achieving  cell-cell  interactions  and  more  realistic  biochemical  and  physiological  responses.  To  date,  many rigid scaffolds have been developed to support neuronal culture,  including  super-porous/non-porous  hydrogels, polydimethylsiloxane with micrometric cavities [14], sintered  titanium  [70],  and  hydrogels  or  matrigels  [59]. 3D  soft  matrix  scaffolds  can  also  be  constructed  using hydrogels,  fibronectin-bound  differentiated  iPSCs,  and 3D  printing  techniques.  Not  only  do  these  approaches maintain the electrophysiological activity of neural tissue compared to rigid scaffolds, but they also allow the mimics to be made into different shapes as needed to accommodate multiple platform applications.\n\nAlthough  scaffolds  can  somewhat  better  mimic  the developing  brain,  they  still  lack  the  cellular  diversity, structural complexity, and physical structure visible in vivo [5]. The development of 3D organoid models and microfluidic organoids has effectively addressed some of these  deficiencies.  3D  organoids  are  grown  from  iPSCs generated from human stem cells or adult cells and have a  similar  composition  and  structure  as  primary  tissues as  well  as  ease  of  manipulation  and  cryopreservation. Organoids have been shown to have well-defined radial glial  cells,  astrocytes,  and  neurons  that  better  mimic human cortical structure during development or in disease states [22, 102, 170]. Early brain organoids derived from  directed  neuroectodermal  differentiation  did  not contain mesodermal lineage cells, such as myeloid microglia or endothelial cells [213]. However, this can now be achieved by co-culturing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and microglia-like cells isolated from primary tissues or differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) with brain organoids [209]. Functional microglia  can  also  be  directly  generated  from  modified unguided  protocols  [201]  or  hESCs  in  human  cortical organoids  (hCOs)  [167].  The  multiple  types  of  human brain  cells  contained  in  the  above  organoids  play  an important role in neurodevelopment and the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases [206]. As a result, 3D organoids can be used to study human diseases that are difficult to simulate using animal models, such as AD.\n\nMicrofluidic  organ-on-a-chip  technology,  which  is  a 'human-on-a-chip' cell culture system for studying physiological  processes,  can  be  used  to  grow  neurons,  glial cells,  endothelial  cells,  and  skeletal  muscle  cells  while providing a highly fluidic extracellular environment and maintaining fluid isolation with a multi-lumen device to better  outline  organ-like  structures  [47].  This  approach also  allows  one  to  manipulate  biological  specimens  and cells  and  simulate  pathological  conditions  with  extraordinary spatial and temporal resolution to reveal mechanistic insights into the disease, thereby accelerating drug discovery, screening, and toxicology research [118, 159].",

[162]  used  CRISPR-Cas9-based  gene  editing  to develop a haploid insufficiency model of sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) (which encodes the endosomal recycling  receptor)  in  Gögenting's  miniature  pigs,  providing support for studying the pathological characteristics of  AD  caused  by SORL1 haploinsufficiency.  However,\n\nat  present,  the  use  of  stem  cell  transplantation  technology to establish cellular humanized animal models-also known  as  chimeras-is  mainly  applied  in  the  research fields of immunology  autoimmunity,  transplantation, infectious  diseases,  and  tumors,  and  is  not  widely  used to study neurodegenerative diseases like AD. To create a humanized AD model, [16] transplanted cortical neurons produced  from  human  iPSCs  into  the  brains  of  transgenic  Tg  (APP/PS1-21)  mice.  Their  goal  was  to  reveal species-specific  vulnerability  of  human  neurons  to  AD pathology.  Disease  processes  and  treatment  advancements in AD have been clarified by this model. Another humanized AD model was constructed by Espuny-Camacho et al. [177], who transplanted healthy human neural precursor cells (NPCs) from iPSCs into the frontal cortex of immunodeficient neonatal transgenic APP/PS1-21 mice [177]. Their study revealed significant degeneration of  transplanted  healthy  human  neurons  upon  exposure to Aβ, microglia, and astrocytes [101]. Chimeric models based on stem cell technology can offer further insights into  AD  pathogenesis.  For  example,  by  constructing  a chimeric  mouse  model  with  grafted  Clusterin  (CLU) C (CLU    rs11136000 C mutation)  medial  ganglionic  eminence  progenitors  (CLU  hiMGEs),  Chen  et  al.  clarified that  over-activation  of  the  sphingolipid  pathway  may be the underlying mechanism of CLU AD. Using   CLU C\n\nhumanized mice, the study shed light on AD pathogenesis, and highlighted the need for more research on GABA transmitter synthesis abnormalities [169].\n\nHumanized AD animal models constructed by the stem cell transplantation technique described above have significant  advantages  over  3D  models.  Most  importantly, they provide longer latency to capture more critical AD neuropathological  features  including  astrocyte  proliferation, microglia proliferation, synaptic deficiency, dendritic degeneration, neuronal cytoskeleton abnormalities, progressive 4R tau expression, and tau hyperphosphorylation [16]. These advantages allow researchers to understand  the  relative  timing  of  the  appearance  of  different pathological  features  of  AD,  thus  providing  a  valuable platform for studying how aging causes or affects neurodegeneration (Fig. 2).",

        "title": "Amyloid hypothesis",
        "content": "In  1991,  John  Hardy  and  David  Alsop  proposed  the β-amyloid  cascade  hypothesis  [180],  which  suggested that  extracellular  β-amyloid  (Aβ)  in  the  cerebral  cortex is  the  central  component  of  brain  senile  plaques  in  AD patients  and  that  its  deposition  is  the  central  cause  of patient morbidity. Aβ is a short neurotoxic peptide produced by successive cleavage of APP by β-secretase and γ-secretase  enzymes  [115].  It  can  rapidly  aggregate  to form  oligomers  that  are  recognized  as  potent  synaptotoxins,  inducing  synaptic  loss  and  memory  impairment to  some  extent  [135].  In  contrast,  autosomal  dominant mutations in APP, presenilin-1 (PSEN1), and presenilin-2 (PSEN2) have been observed in patients with familial AD (fAD), and these mutations are responsible for the pathogenic aggregation of Aβ peptides into neuritis plaques [130]. Even without such mutations, similar pathological changes can be observed in sporadic AD (sAD). Thus, it is  presumed  that  insufficient  brain  Aβ  clearance  is  the key event leading to its aggregation [84].\n\nStem  cell-derived  disease  models  have  played  a  key role  in  the  formation  and  development  of  the  above hypothesis. In 2011, Yagi et al. established the first fADiPSC-derived neuron model carrying PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutations. These neurons were found to have increased Aβ42  secretion,  while PSEN fAD  mutations  impaired γ-secretase activity, thus confirming the pathogenic link between fAD and PS1 and PS2 mutations [149]. To further  identify  the  phenotypes  common  to  fAD,  [116] selected  cortical  neurons  produced  by  iPSCs  carrying different APP and/or PSEN1 mutations as a model. They found  that  endosomal  transport  defects  in  AD  were caused  by  APP  cleavage  by-product  β  C-terminal  fragment  (β-CTF),  as  shown  by  analysis  of  their  transcriptome  and  translatome.  This  finding  suggests  that  the pathological mechanism of AD is not limited to Aβ, and that future research should target other APP metabolites (such  as  β-CTF)  to  prevent  neurodegeneration  [116]. Using  this  disease  model,  future  research  could  also test whether endosomal changes are related to neuronal death  and  whether  blocking  the  accumulation  of  other APP  metabolites  such  as  β-CTF  can  prevent  neurodegeneration.  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  humanized  AD mouse models have also played a key role in evaluating the amyloid hypothesis [208].\n\nIn  addition  to  the  2D  models  described  above,  3D cell  culture  systems  and  humanized  AD  models  have been used to assess this hypothesis. Li et al. [190] constructed  a  3D  hydrogel  culture  system  and  observed many extracellular Aβ deposits in fAD ReN cells after 6 weeks of differentiation. Choi, Park, and Lee [171] established a 3D neurospheroid model consisting of prenatal rat (not human) cortical neurons and synthetic Aβ42 to test Aβ toxicity in a microfluidic platform [171]. In 2017, researchers generated a humanized AD model by transplanting  human  iPSC-derived  cortical  neurons  into  the brains  of  transgenic  Tg  (APP/PS1-21)  mice  [16].  In  the comparison of human and mouse neurons, it was found that the Aβ plaque morphology in human neuron clusters was more diffuse than the dense core plaques in mouse brains, further revealing the species-specific vulnerability of human neurons to AD pathology. This model has provided key insights for the development of the AD amyloid hypothesis.",

        "content": "Given  the  failure  of  amyloid-based  therapies  for  AD, researchers' interest in tau has increased. Tau is a protein with roles in the stabilization and assembly of neuronal microtubules  (MAP)  that  is  mainly  expressed  in  neurons,  oligodendrocytes,  and  astrocytes  in  the  CNS  and peripheral  nervous  system  [127].  Tau  proteins  control microtubule  stability  through  heterodimerization  and phosphorylation.  Hyperphosphorylation  of  tau  leads  to abnormal function and aggregation, further forming neurofibrillary  tangles  (NFTs).  The  combination  of  toxicity acquired  by  aggregates  or  their  precursors  and  the  deleterious effects of loss of normal tau function in disease states may be an important cause of neurodegeneration [8].\n\nScientists  are  currently  attempting  to  use  stem  cellderived  pathological  models  to  address  an  important but unresolved question in AD: the relationship between tau  pathology  and  Aβ,  i.e.,  whether  tau  protein  aggregation  is  secondary  to  Aβ  deposition  or  an  independent  factor  directly  contributing  to  neurodegeneration. In  2012,  Israel  et  al.  [53]  reprogrammed  primary  fibroblasts  from  two  patients  with  fAD  and  found  that  tau\n\nphosphorylation was increased in neurons carrying APP repeat  mutations  and  that  β-secretase  inhibitors  significantly  reduced  tau  phosphorylation  by  blocking  Aβ production [53].  Wang et al.  [137,  215,  216]  found  that the  elevated  level  of  hyperphosphorylated  tau  in  iPSCderived  neurons  carrying  apolipoprotein  E4  (APOE4) was not dependent on Aβ in APOE4 , paving the way for studies on other factors underlying tau phosphorylation. A  more  extensive  study  was  conducted  by  [121].  who performed  shRNA  knockdown  screening  of  more  than 50  AD  risk  genes  in  iPSC-derived  neurons  to  examine the effects on Aβ deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation and their interconnections. They found that FERM domain  containing  kindlin  2  (FERMT2)  expression  in neurons promoted late-onset AD (LOAD) formation and deterioration by increasing Aβ accumulation and tau levels [121].\n\nTaken together, these findings demonstrate that human iPSC-derived neurons can effectively reflect the early features of AD pathogenesis, including the accumulation of pathogenic Aβ species and early tau disease. These results have  important  implications  for  further  research  and refinement of hypotheses and interrelationships between tau pathology and Aβ. Notably, both 3D culture models and  humanized  organoid  models  better  show  extracellular β-amyloid aggregation and NFT pathology than 2D neuronal cultures, providing a more robust model for AD research [121].",

        "content": "Genome-wide  association  studies  (GWAS)  have  identified  many  risk  genes  associated  with  different  types of  AD. Examples of these risk genes are summarized in Table 1.\n\nStem cell technology combined with gene editing techniques can shed light on the role of risk genes in AD and the interplay between environmental factors and genetic background. CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing and its derivatives have enabled efficient genetic modification of hiPSCs.  The  resulting  'homozygous  pairs'  have  greatly improved  the  resolution  of  disease-specific  phenotypes and  circumvented  the  need  to  collect  patient  cell  lines with  different  genetic  backgrounds,  thereby  facilitating research on the role of risk genes in AD [37].\n\nApolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk site  for  LOAD  [25].It  also  plays  an  important  role  in maintaining  membrane  homeostasis,  supporting  synaptic integrity, and healing brain injury. In humans, APOE has three isoforms: APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4. [158] demonstrated  that  human  iPSC-derived  astrocytes  are a  powerful  platform  for  exploring  the  role  of  APOE  ε4 isoforms in AD. They found that, when co-cultured with iPSC-derived neurons, human iPSC-derived APOE ε4/ε4 astrocytes promoted neuronal survival and synaptogenesis, whereas APOE ε4/ε4 astrocytes were not as effective as astrocytes with the APOE ε3/ε3 genotype in supporting  these  neurotrophic  functions  [158].  Sienski  et  al. (2021) also used this platform to explore the relationship between lipid metabolism and APOEε4 mutations. They demonstrated that APOE4, but not APOE3, disrupts the lipidome of iPSC-derived astrocytes [113]. 3D brain organoids from AD patients have been used in related studies. Zhao et al. [223] found that brain organoids from AD patients carrying APOE ε4/ε4 showed greater apoptosis and  lower  synaptic  integrity  and  that  APOE4-related pathways were directly associated with pathological tau protein accumulation. CRISPR/Cas9 technology has also contributed greatly to research on APOE4.

These  findings  provide  a reference for the design of future gene therapies targeting AD risk genes [68].\n\nTREM2 ,  another  important  AD  risk  gene,  has  been extensively studied using stem cell-derived disease models. TREM2 encodes  the  myeloid  trigger  receptor  2, which is a cell surface transmembrane protein produced in the brain by microglia that primarily regulates microglial  cell  survival  and  activation  [75].  Mutations  in  this gene increase the chance of developing AD by 200-400% above  the  normal  level  [43,  61].  McQuade  et  al.  [195] analyzed  microglia  differentiated  in  CRISPR-modified TREM2  knockdown  iPSC  lines  [195].  By  combining multi-omics analysis with a chimeric AD mouse model, they found that TREM2 deletion reduced microglia survival,  impaired  phagocytosis of key substrates including APOE, and inhibited SDF-1α/CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis, ultimately leading to impaired uptake of β-amyloid plaques  in  vivo.  By  combining  chronic  demyelination paradigms  and  cell  sorting  with  RNA  sequencing  and lipidomics, Nugent et al. [200] elucidated the causal link between abnormal cholesterol transport and metabolism in  TREM2-deficient  microglia  and  the  accumulation  of toxic proteins in the brain, confirming that TREM2 deficiency exacerbates AD pathology.\n\nIn summary, stem cell technology can also be used to conduct GWAS. The genomes of iPSCs are more stable and  reflect  the  genetic  information  of  individuals  more realistically than the traditional cell lines used in GWAS research. Furthermore, since iPSCs can differentiate into various cell types associated with AD, they can better  mimic  GWAS-related  diseases.  CRISPR-based  gene editing  technology  can  introduce  knockouts  or  singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNPs)-targeted mutations into iPSCs, thus providing a high-throughput platform to functionally validate AD-related SNPs and genes [46].",

        "title": "Abnormal mitochondrial structure and function",
        "content": "There  is  growing  evidence  that  impaired  mitochondrial biogenesis  and  function  are  involved  in  many  neurodegenerative diseases and can impair synaptic neurotransmission, which is essential for normal cognitive function. As  a  neurodegenerative  disease  [114],  aging  is  a  major risk factor for AD. However, the reprogramming step of iPSC  technology  resets  age-related  features  (e.g.,  mitochondrial  dysfunction,  telomere  shortening,  etc.)  back to the fetal stage, [74], meaning that stem cell models are useful for not only studying disease mechanisms but also disease processes-especially early biological and pathological  events  that  disrupt  neurological  maintenance.\n\nStem  cells  and  their  derived  models  thus  provide  a highly exploitable platform to study structural-functional changes in mitochondria early in AD development. They can also help us better understand the molecular basis of mitochondrial  heterogeneity  in  structure  and  function. Stem  cells  with  normal  or  abnormal  mitochondria  can be generated from healthy people and patients and then differentiated  into  various  cell  lineages.  This  approach allows  us  to  investigate  how  the  state  of  mitochondria affects  stem  cells'  ability  to  generate  different  cell  types and  regulate  remodeling  in  disease-specific  cells.  As proof  of  concept,  we  can  use  patient-derived  stem  cell platforms to investigate the role of mitochondria in AD development. This approach represents a paradigm shift in  understanding  the  role  of  mitochondria  in  human disease and opens up new avenues for AD research and therapy.\n\nUsing  stem  cell-derived  models,  many  studies  have shown that  mitochondrial  dysfunction,  including  metabolic disorders, increased ROS production, altered mitochondrial  morphology,  and  dysregulation  of  mitochondrial  quality  control  (QC)  [211,  218],  are  early signs  of  AD  progression  and  contribute  to  disease  progression.  GWAS have identified variants in the ABCA7 gene encoding ATP-binding cassette (ABC) subfamily A member 7 that are strong risk factors for late-onset AD [183].  By  constructing  ABCA7-deficient  iPSC-derived cortical organoids, Kawatani et al. proposed a new mechanism of AD-related neuronal injury caused by ABCA7 function  loss:  ABCA7  deficiency  interferes  with  mitochondrial lipid metabolism, damages mitochondrial respiration, produces excessive ROS, enlarges mitochondrial morphology,  and  leads  to  disruption  of  mitochondrial homeostasis  and  synaptic  function  of  neurons  [188]. Mitochondrial QC includes fission and fusion processes, mitochondrial trafficking, and  mitophagy  [214].  The constant  change  of  mitochondrial  structure  and  shape through continuous fusion and fission is a process called mitochondrial  dynamics  [165].  There  is  growing  evidence  that  dysfunction  of  mitochondrial  dynamics  may be the pathological cause of delayed onset neurodegenerative diseases such as AD [165]. When the contents and organelles  of  mitochondria  are  damaged,  mitochondrial autophagy  is  triggered.[191].  Mitochondrial  autophagy is a process that selectively removes damaged mitochondria,  plays  an  essential  role  in  regulating  the  number of  intracellular  mitochondria  and  maintaining  normal mitochondrial function [161]. In the early course of AD, Fang  et  al.  [178]  observed  widespread  impaired  mitochondrial  autophagy  in  iPSC  human  AD  neurons.[178] To  investigate  the  effect  of  APP  cleavage  products  on mitochondria  function,  Lee  et  al.  (2022)  used  induced neural  stem  cells  (iNSC)  derived  from  fibroblasts  of  an\n\nAD patient  origin  as  a  model.  They  concluded  that  the accumulation of APP-derived C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) within the structural domain of mitochondria may be responsible for dysfunction such as impaired mitochondrial autophagy [64]. Martin-Maestro et al. [80] observed  that  dysfunctional  mitochondria  accumulated due to impaired mitochondrial autophagy in skin fibroblast iPSC-derived neurons carrying fAD -associated mutations.  They  further  determined  that  the  defective autophagic process was caused by a reduced autophagic degradation  phase  due  to  lysosomal  abnormalities  [80]. They  also  constructed  hiPSC-derived  NSCs  carrying the  fAD-associated  PS1  M146L  mutation  and  identified mitochondrial respiratory chain defects, such as low expression levels of key enzymes like cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV), cytochrome c reductase (complex III), fusion proteins like mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), and autophagy-associated proteins light chain 3  (LC3) . Reduced  expression  of  lysosomal  associated membrane protein 1  (LAMP1) and transcription  factor EB (TFEB) may further contribute to the accumulation of defective mitochondria. These findings suggest that early metabolic  alterations  and  impaired  mitochondrial  QC may have consequences for the pathophysiology of AD.\n\nBecause  autopsy  does  not  provide  relevant  information  about  disease  progression,  it  is  critical  to  develop model  systems  to  study  early  molecular  changes.  AD human  iPSC-derived  models  are  thus  complementary tools  to  study  the  degenerative  process.  Researchers have used such models to demonstrate the critical role of early events like mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired mitochondrial autophagy on AD  pathogenesis [81]. Besides  DNA  in  nuclei,  cDNA  mutations  in  mitochondria  are  another  potentially  important  cause  of  AD,  as well as the root of aging, and thus deserve our attention [222].  Researchers  should  focus  on  mitochondria  signal pathways and mitochondria-targeted therapy to improve obstacle stress and energy metabolism in AD, ultimately improving our understanding of the interaction between genetic  and  environmental  factors  that  contribute  to mitochondria dysfunction in AD.",

        "content": "There is an intricate link between the immune system and CNS; when this balance is broken, it can cause neuroinflammation  and,  ultimately,  AD.  Neuroinflammation  is an inflammatory response in the CNS caused by various pathological injuries. In this process, CNS glial cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, produce various pro-inflammatory  cytokines,  such  as  Interleukin-1β  (IL-1β),  IL-6, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and chemokines, as well  as  small  molecule  messengers  and  reactive  oxygen species [31]. CNS glial cells thus play an important role in the progression of inflammation.\n\nStem  cell  technology  allows  researchers  to  study  the interplay between immune function and AD using models like co-culture of immune cells from a single patient with  their  organoids  [82].  As  stem  cell-derived  3D  cultures  can  generate  human  oligodendrocyte  spheroids, astrocyte  spheroids,  and  neurons,  these  models  can  be applied to investigate glial cell functional abnormalities, different glial cell interactions, neuronal interaction networks,  and  the  mechanisms  of  AD  immune  disorders. Bianco et al. [10] used a microfluidic platform to investigate  the  complex  roles  of  different  regional  astrocytes in  neuroinflammation.  They  inoculated  astrocytes  from the  cortex  and  hippocampus,  as  well  as  primary  hippocampal neuron cell types, from rat embryos in different chambers of the microfluidic network. By examining the effects on neuronal viability in two neuroinflammatory  injury  models  (i.e.,  metabolic  stress  and  exposure to  amyloid  β  protofibrils),  they  clarified  the  differential contributions  of  brain  region-specific  neuroglia  in  two in  vitro  models.  This  study  reflects  the  superiority  of 3D microfluidic  organ  chips  with  multiple  chambers  to independently control culture conditions and selectively differentiate stem cells into different cell types with different stimuli. As this is also an open-ended method, it allows  close  monitoring  of  the  specific  contribution  of each cell type by analyzing morphology, viability, calcium kinetic, and electrophysiological parameters when different chambers are micro fluidically connected [10]. Such models can reveal the complexity of cell-cell interactions in  neuroinflammation, which is of great importance for elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved. To study the  effect  of  the  immune  system  on  neuronal  signaling, Guttikonda et al. [44] established a well-defined human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC)-derived tri-culture system containing pure populations of hPSC-derived microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. Using this culture system, they were able to demonstrate that increased complement C3 production in the brain is partly caused by microglia activation and its interaction with astrocytes, which in turn worsens neuroinflammation [44].\n\nSynthetic  models  with  AD  features  have  also  been developed. For example, Park et al. [95] used this technique  to  create  a  human  ternary  culture  model  containing  NPC-derived  neurons  and  astrocytes  as  well  as immortalized  human  microglia.  This  method  reflected the  phenomena  of  microglia  recruitment,  neurotoxic activity,  and  nitrogen  monoxide (NO) release damaging AD  neurons  and  astrocytes  and  is  suitable  for  further investigating the complex molecular mechanisms of neuroinflammation that underlie AD pathology [95]. Human pluripotent stem cell-derived brain-like Organoids\n\nco-cultured with immune cells from AD patients can also be used to better understand inter-glial interactions and provide  an  ideal  experimental  platform  to  explore  the mechanisms of AD immune dysfunction under an in vivo growth environment.\n\nAs a proof of concept, we can use patient-derived stem cell platforms to study the role of the immune system and various glial cell communication disorders in the development of AD. This represents a paradigm shift in understanding  the  role  of  immunity  in  human  disease  and opens new avenues for AD research and treatment. In the future, new models could be developed to evaluate novel therapeutical interventions for AD such as immunomodulatory therapy, anti-inflammatory drugs, and immunoglobulin therapy.\n\nIn  summary,  reprogramming  somatic  cells  from  AD patients  back  to  stem  cells  that  can  be  re-differentiated into in vitro disease models to probe disease progression and  pathogenesis  provides  a  new  approach  for  understanding  the  pathogenesis  of  human  neurodegenerative  diseases.  This  approach  also  takes  advantage  of  the reverse engineering platform to monitor and determine key  pathogenetic  events  during  disease  development. The hallmark of degeneration of the aging brain is selective  cell  vulnerability  in  disease-specific  patterns  many decades after the birth of long-lived brain cells. The traditional  paradigm  for  investigating  neurodegeneration has  been  to  define  the  biological  processes  and  pathways mediating brain cell dysfunction and death during the adult life; neurodegenerative diseases have thus been considered  a  discrete  pathological  entity  rather  than  a continuum  of  a  common  pathogenic  process.  The  new perspective  considers  neurodegenerative  diseases  as  a fundamental  disorder  of  neural  development  in  which subtle impairment in the regional programming of neural  development  results  in  selective  neural  and  brain network vulnerability to a spectrum of late-life stressors. Indeed, emerging data support the possibility of pathogenic associations between abnormalities in the birth and death of vulnerable brain cell subtypes [210].",

        "content": "Good disease models can be used to explore the diverse pathogenesis of diseases and support drug screening and development. However, drugs to stop AD progression are currently lacking. One important reason for this is that current  drug  screening  methods  typically  rely  on  holistic animal models and cell lines as pharmacological and toxicological testing systems. Animal models of AD have species  differences  and  cannot  fully  represent  human responses, while most human cell lines are immortalized tumor cell lines that hardly reflect the reactivity of normal human cells.\n\nAlternatively, in vitro differentiation of stem cells as a model  of  normal  human  development  can  be  used  for drug screening or to obtain multiple normal somatic cell types  to  test  the  toxicological  effects  of  drugs  on  specific  cells.  The  use  of  iPSC  in  vitro  differentiated  cells to  screen  new  drugs  can  greatly  reduce  the  number  of experimental  animals  required  for  drug  experiments. The  use  of  stem  cells  to  establish  models  that  comprehensively reflect the pathological phenotype and disease mechanisms of  human  AD  is  thus  of  great  significance for AD drug development and screening.\n\nIn 2017, Kondo et al. presented a platform for drug discovery  and  development  using  human  iPSCs  and  compound screening. They used 13 iPSC-differentiated pure cortical neurons from AD patients. After two rounds of screening,  the  final  screen  q  yielded  six  potential  compounds that could minimize Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels. Such models can help overcome the drawbacks encountered in drug development and screening using standard human iPSC platforms [56, 123].\n\nSimple models of iPSC-derived neurons have failed to account  for  interactions  with  vascular  cells,  glial  cells, and  the  blood-brain  barrier  (BBB).  The  BBB  is  a  major factor  limiting  the  action  of  AD  drugs.  Moreover,  BBB dysfunction  and  catabolism  have  been  observed  in  AD, which in turn triggers a series of inflammatory responses and neuronal loss and neurodegeneration. The development of specific AD BBB models and their application in preclinical  studies  are  therefore  important  for  improving  the  success  of  AD  drug  clinical  trials.  Many  recent studies  have  reported  successfully  applying  combined iPSC and microfluidic  technology  to  mimic  the  BBB  in a  neuro-neuroglial  interaction  model  [132].  The  use  of iPSC-derived BBB models in combination with gene editing  (e.g.,  CRISPR/Cas-9  technology)  to  mimic  diseaseassociated  mutations  or  introduce  artificial  mutations (e.g.,  gene  knockout)  can  better  reflect  altered  brain dynamics  in  disease  states  and  help  screen  new  drugs that  can  reach  deeper  neural  tissues  through  the  BBB [4, 112]. Gene-edited iPSCs expanded and differentiated in vitro into different cell types can also be transplanted into  AD  animal  models  to  generate  human-animal  chimeras for drug screening [136, 142].",

        "content": "In addition to their value as disease models and for drug screening, stem cells have played a significant role in treating  AD.  The  transplantation  of  stem  cells  to  treat  AD  is mainly  based  on  their  ability  to  differentiate  into  neurons and glial cells that can replace damaged cells, release\n\ncytokines to activate endogenous neurogenesis, and regulate  immune cell status. Transplanted stem cells also can be induced to differentiate into glial cells or corresponding precursor cells to improve the neuronal environment by  repairing  the  functions  of  supporting  cells,  ultimately repairing overall neural network  function.  Stem  cells can also act therapeutically through the contents of their secretomes, e.g. exosomes. Unlike monoclonal antibodies or enzyme inhibitors that target Aβ to slow down the pathological  process,  stem  cells  have  the  potential  to  rebuild the  integrity  of  the  CNS.  Moreover,  given  the  interconnectedness  of  the  various  mechanisms  of  AD  pathology, targeting just one for treatment may not be as effective as therapies  targeting  various  factors-stem  cells  have  the potential to treat AD via multiple mechanisms (Fig. 3).",

        "content": "The  formation  of  Aβ  and  its  damage  to  the  neurological  system  is  one  of  the  best  known  pathological  processes  in  AD  [141].  Clearing  Aβ  from  the  brain  is  thus thought  to  be  one  of  the  most  promising  ways  to  treat AD.  Stem  cell  transplantation  could  reduce  Aβ  deposition  through  the  following  mechanisms:  activation  of microglia to eliminate Aβ through specific phagocytosis [62,  63],  regulation  of  the  expression  levels  of  enzymes related to Aβ synthesis or degradation (e.g., upregulation of  α-secretase  activity  or  downregulation  of  γ-secretase or  β-secretase activity) [224], or removal of existing Aβ deposits  through  immunotherapy.  These  effects  on  Aβ could  occur  separately  or  simultaneously  [189].  The clearance of Aβ is frequently accompanied by microglia,\n\nFig. 3 The role of stem cell-based therapies in the treatment of AD. A Through direct transplantation, retransplantation following differentiation into neural cells, and secretory exosome infusion, stem cells offer various benefits for treating AD. B Stem cells with their differentiated cells and derived exosomes regulate the release of a range of cytokines, reducing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and increasing levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), IL-10) in cerebrospinal fluid. C The phenotypes of microglia and astrocytes are changed by stem cells through their differentiated cells and exosomes, shifting them from a pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory phenotype and decreasing the inflammatory response in the brain and promoting neuroactivity. D Stem cells with their differentiated cells and derived exosomes are upregulated with Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), etc. The stem cells transplanted through exogenous pathways are integrated into the neural network to regenerate synapses. E As MSCs with their differentiated cells and exosomes activate microglia, they specifically phagocytose Aβ or regulate the expression levels of Aβ-related enzymes (e.g., upregulate α-secretase activity or downregulate β-secretase activity) to clear existing Aβ deposits\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhowever, this does not mean that microglia activation is essential for stem cell transplantation therapy to achieve Aβ clearance [144].\n\nHyperphosphorylation of tau protein and NFT production are also significant pathological aspects of AD, and different tau structures may mediate different pathogenic processes.  However,  more  extensive  research  on  how stem  cells  can  improve  tau  pathology  is  required  [36, 38]. Nevertheless, it is important to investigate potential improvement in tau pathology by stem cell therapy given the current assumption that tau pathology may develop independently  of  Aβ  pathology.  There  is  adequate  evidence  that  stem  cell  transplantation  can  improve  the activity of cells damaged by abnormal tau protein neurotoxicity. For example, Zilka et al. [226] co-cultured AT tau cells,  a  model  of  AD  cells  developed from human truncated  tau  protein  (Tau151-391,  4R),  with  mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and found that this greatly enhanced cell  viability,  demonstrating  that  MSC  therapy  rescued cells  from  toxic  tau  protein.  The  researchers  suggested that this effect of MSCs is partly attributed to the complex bioactive components in their secretomes. They also reported that MSCs encouraged neurite development in cells  expressing  truncated  tau.  These  findings  demonstrate that stem cell therapy can reduce cellular damage caused by toxic tau proteins-at least in in vitro experiments [226]. However, the therapeutic effect of stem cell transplantation  on  tau-oligomers-burdened  models  still needs to be explored, for tau oligomers is now observed to cause serious synapse elimination [212].\n\nOne  of  the  most  significant  therapeutic  functions  of stem cells in neurodegenerative disorders is replacement of  senescent,  damaged  neurons.  When  stem  cells  like iPSC-NPCs are pre-induced in vitro to differentiate into cholinergic  neurons  and  then  reimplanted  they  could improve memory and cognitive function. They have been proven to survive and differentiate  into  cholinergic  and GABAergic neurons when directly transplanted to lesion sites. The positive effects of stem cells on synaptic regeneration  can  be  described  as  endogenous  or  exogenous: exogenous synaptic regeneration is realized through the integration of stem cells implanted into neural networks, whereas  endogenous  synaptic  regeneration  is  realized through  the  promotion  of  synaptic  regeneration  via upregulation of factors positively associated with neurogenesis, e.g., BDNF, NGF, etc.\n\nMany experiments have demonstrated enhancement of synaptic integrity and elevation of neuronal activity after injection of stem cells, and Basal forebrain-like cholinergic  neurons  (BFCN)  progenitor  cells  are  frequently  utilized in experiments [184, 221], indicating the possibility of rebuilding neuronal circuits utilizing exogenous neural stem cells.\n\nAs an alternative to exogenous implantation, numerous studies have sought to achieve brain repair by promoting the expression of endogenous growth factors and, subsequently, repairing neuronal circuits. In many studies, the upregulation  of  proteins  associated  with  antioxidation, synaptic connectivity, and neurogenesis such as sirtuin1 (Sirt1), BDNF, synuclein (SYN), and β-nerve growth factor  (β-NGF),  has  been  observed.  [157,  172,  175]  Stem cells'  secretomes  or  the  trophic  factors  produced  after their  differentiation  into  glial  cells  also  act  as  sources of  neurotrophic  factors.  For  instance,  using  co-culture experiments, Peng et al. [203] showed that BM-MSCs can differentiate into Schwann cells and promote the quantity and  length  of  sprouting  neurons  of  dorsal  root  ganglia neurons.\n\nHowever, other studies suggest that the delivery of neurotrophic factors is not the primary benefit of stem cells for  treating  neurodegenerative  illnesses  [34].  Although delivery  of  neurotrophic  factors  may  appear  to  be  less effective  at  rescuing  neurodegeneration,  this  technique can  be  utilized  to  enhance  the  therapeutic  efficacy  of stem cell transplantation.\n\nFor example, using BDNF-transfected MSCs for transplantation,  Song  et  al.  [117]  showed  that  the  neuroprotective effect of BDNF increased the activity and synaptic integrity of primary cultured neurons in APP/PS1 mice. The  transplanted  BDNF-MSCs  differentiated  into  neuronal  cells,  increased  the  number  of  local  cholinergic neurons,  promoted  Acetylcholine  (Ach)  secretion,  and improved  cognitive  function  [117]. Overall, synaptic regeneration may be more effectively promoted by combining  the  secretion  of  neurotrophic  factors  with  the exogenous replacement of neurons.\n\nGiven increasing emphasis and support for the 'infection  theory'  of  AD,  neuroinflammation  mitigation  has become an innovative treatment approach [51, 85], and the modulatory effects of stem cell infusion therapies on immunological function in the CNS are becoming focal areas.\n\nAs  one  of  the  most  common  immune  cell  types  in the  CNS,  microglia  maintain  and  protect  neural  cells by  controlling  inflammation  and  preserving  the  integrity  of  the  microenvironment,  among  other  methods [166]. In AD, related gene expression in certain microglia  changes during the course of the disease [83], the expression of these genes in certain microglia has been shown  to  rescue  neurodegeneration  [61].  Thus,  altering microglia activity is considered a potential method for treating AD. In APP/PS1 mice treated with human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells  (hUCB-MSCs),  [63]  demonstrated  an  increase in  microglia  in  the  alternative  activation  state  and  a decrease in neuroinflammation. In addition, Yokokawa\n\n[220] showed that MSCs transplantation into the brains of  APdE9 mice induced microglia to convert from the M1  phenotype  to  the  M2  phenotype  and  engage  in phagocytosis,  while  also  reducing  neuroinflammation and enhancing the redox state. Besides, the transition between different microglia phenotypes, lower expression  of  pro-inflammatory  factors  (TNF-,  IL-6,  and Monocyte  chemoattractant  protein-1  (MCP-1))  and decreases  in  the  quantity  and  volume  of  microglia  in the cortex have been observed in stem cell transplantation studies [197].\n\nRather than a one-way influence, there is mutual action between neural stem cells and microglia [207]. Thus, the efficacy of stem cell transplantation is likely to be influenced by the microglia's state of activation. In support of this, a study by Popova et al. [204] showed that microglia could induce transcriptional changes in neural stem cells and  reduce  interferon  signaling  response  genes,  while interferon-induced  transmembrane  protein  3  (IFITM3) was  previously  shown  to  upregulate  γ-secretase  activity to increase Aβ production. By co-culturing activated microglia with NPC, Lilienberg et al. [67] demonstrated that  naïve  microglia  do  not  affect  the  proliferation  of NPCs  and  enhanced  neurosynaptic  growth.  Using  this co-culture  system,  the  authors  also  observed  that  the nitro  blebbistatin-triggered  synaptic  development  was enhanced  by  naïve  microglia.  [67].  Popova  et  al.  [204] showed that microglia can induce transcriptional changes in neural stem cells and accelerate the emergence of synchronized oscillatory network activity in brain organoids, which has implications for the integration  of  stem  cells into  the  original  neural  network  following  transplantation. These findings have revealed the potential of using drug  induction  in  stem  cell  therapy  and  the  important effect  the  environment's  microglia  status  has  on  neural stem  cells.  More  importantly,  not  all  instances  of  activated  microglia  cause  damage  to  neurons.  Thus,  preregulating  the  state  of  microglia  in  the  environment  or combining it with drug induction may need to be considered when designing stem cell transplantation therapies.\n\nIn  terms  of  other  parts  of  the  immunoregulation  system is the CNS, the glymphatic system, which is related to  various  diseases  like  Parkinson's  [122],  diabetes  [55], hypertension [89], and aging [57], has recently attracted attention  for  its  role  in  brain  homeostasis.  The  glymphatic  system  controls  the  clearance  of  various  toxic compounds  that  develop  with  aging  or  other  changes from  the  brain,  including  Aβ  proteins  linked  to  AD. Astrocytes play a significant role in the glymphatic system, such as removing waste proteins by regulating cerebrospinal  fluid  shunting  via  aquaporin-4  (AQP-4).  A promising approach to treating AD thus involves altering astrocyte activity through stem cell transplantation.\n\nPrevious  studies  have  reported  that  stem  cells  can inhibit the proliferation of astrocytes and encourage the development of non-reactive astrocytes, which have the capacity  to  support  synaptic  regeneration,  heal  injured neurons,  and  engage  in  phagocytosis  and  Aβ  catabolism [6]. Because abnormal cerebrospinal fluid-mediated immune  function  has  significant  implications  for  AD pathology and stem cell transplantation has been shown to  improve  some  causes  of  glymphatic  system  disorders-including upregulation of aquaporin (AQP-4) expression  and  attenuation  of  astrocyte  proliferationthe  beneficial  effects  of  stem  cells  on  the  lymphoid-like system warrant further investigation [97, 143]. One novel avenue for future stem cell research in AD may be stem cell manipulation of astrocyte protein expression, which in turn influences the effectiveness of material exchange and waste clearance in the lymphoid system.\n\nIn  summary,  stem  cell  transplantation  therapy  has been shown to not only improve typical pathology indicators of AD, such as Aβ and Tau fiber tangles, but also to  have  a  reciprocal  modulatory  effect  on  numerous important immune system cell types, including microglia and astrocytes. These various efficacies most likely work together  to  achieve  the  neuronal  regeneration  and  cognitive improvement observed after transplantation. Preconditioning  the  microenvironment  of  the  treated  area or combining neural stem cells with certain glial precursor cells (GPCs) may be a workable therapeutic approach when considering the interactions between cells and their environments.",

        "content": "Although  neurons  may  be  directly  responsible  for  cognitive  function,  their  sustained  activity  relies  largely  on support from glial cells, which account for the majority of  brain  cell  populations.  The  repeated  failures  of  strategies  to  eliminate  abnormal  protein  aggregates  in  AD patients-such as Aβ aggregation inhibitors, Aβ antigens, anti-Aβ  monoclonal/polyclonal  antibodies,  γ-secretase inhibitors,  γ-secretase  modulators,  and  β-site  amyloid precursor  protein  cleaving  enzyme  (BACE)  inhibitorsmay teach us a lesson: although glial cells have long been ignored, they make important contributions to the onset and progression of AD.\n\nGlial cells are now widely recognized to have potential for AD research and therapy. Using disease models based on glial cells, it is possible to investigate AD pathogenesis in a more systemic way. With rapid developments in stem cell technology, more attention is being paid to glial cell transplantation  therapies.  The  three  major  approaches to  transplanting  glial  cells  derived  from  stem  cells  are microglia transplantation, astrocyte transplantation, and  oligodendrocyte  transplantation.  NSCs,  GPCs,  and\n\npluripotent  stem  cells  (PSCs)  are  some  sources  of  stem cells  used  for  glial  cell  transplantation.  GPCs  can  also be obtained from PSCs. Given the potential of stem cellderived neuroglia platforms and therapies, it is necessary to  discuss  possible  approaches  to  glia-based  platforms and transplantation therapy.\n\nStem  cell-derived  glia  in  disease  modeling Given  the important role of glial cells in maintaining a stable brain environment  and  neuronal  health,  it  is  necessary  to involve multiple glial cell types in the construction of disease models. Accordingly, glial cell-based models of AD need to be developed using different glia types to establish in vitro and in vivo models. Such models will enable researchers to study AD in a more controlled and systemic manner to identify novel treatments.\n\nMany studies using AD disease models containing glial cells  have  provided  new  understandings  of  pathological processes. Complement C3 is a protein that is increased under inflammatory conditions and implicated in synaptic loss. Guttikonda et al. [44] identified the main reason for increased C3 in AD and the main cell types involved being  microglia  versus  astrocytes  using  a  hPSC-derived microglia  and  tri-culture  system  model  [44].  By  using neurons, astrocytes,  and  microglia  in  a  3D  microfluidic platform, Park et al. [95]. presented a 3D human AD triculture  model  that  mirrors  microglial  recruitment  and important neurotoxic activities in AD [95].\n\nTo  summarize,  to  deepen  our  understanding  of  AD pathogenesis  and  promote  AD  therapy,  more  research is needed to help design glia-based AD models that mirror typical activity in AD. A tri-culture system comprising all three kinds of neuroglia may be a more promising approach than using a single glial cell type. This suggests that human brain organoids comprising neurons and several types of glial cells should be an ideal platform for AD research. However, additional studies about the different glia subtypes are warranted, since the subtypes have different  functions  and  may  thus  have  different  effects  on AD pathology.\n\nStem cell-derived glia  in  AD  therapy Traditional  brain cell  therapies  tend  to  use  ectogenic  neurons  to  replace damaged ones. However, this type of transplantation has numerous drawbacks, many of which are caused by neurons' ability to be excited. In some cases, neuron transplantation can cause convulsion in mice, which can eventually lead to death. Ectogenic neurons are thought to be responsible for these severe side effect because they are more excitable [105]. Further research is clearly needed to explore additional cell types for cell replacement therapies for  AD.  Glial  cells,  including  microglia,  astrocytes,  and oligodendrocytes,  play  crucial  roles  in  maintaining  the environment in the human brain and regulating processes over the lifecycle of neurons. Glial cells are now considered  a  promising  choice  because  they  positively  influence neurons in many ways, including secretion of factors,  phagocytosis, and direct interaction between cells. Glial cells are also comparatively safe for transplantation because  they  are  non-excitable,  thereby  protecting  the recipient from hypo-excitation.",

        "content": "Due  to  their  ability  to  activate  and  escalate  neuroinflammatory responses, microglia have long been considered one of the main contributors to damage caused by neuroinflammation.  However,  based  on  in-depth  studies  on  microglia  function  and  state,  current  microglia therapies  no  longer  advocate  comprehensive  suppression  of  their  functions,  but  rather  distinct  strategies  to promote  alleviation  of  neuroinflammation  that  are  tailored  to  the  microenvironment  of  the  specific  disease. Due to the extended longevity of microglia and the fact that  the  gradual  loss  of  homeostasis  is  associated  with AD pathogenesis, the low efficiency of nascent microglia in removing aggregates of toxic proteins may encourage the pathological processes of AD. To restore their natural  immunological  filtering  function,  senescent  microglia should be rejuvenated or healthy microglia could be replenished  endogenously  or  exogenously  as  part  of  an AD treatment strategy. Exogenous microglia supplementation or stem cell-derived microglia transplantation are potential approaches to reestablish central immune clearance. In bone marrow transplantation (BMT), microglialike cells produced from iPSCs, ESCs, or monocytes are the main cell sources for microglia transplantation. Several  studies  have  reported  successful  transplantation  of microglia  into  the  mouse  brain  and  validation  of  functional integration of microglia after transplantation [145, 145, 147, 147]. Notably, the microglia showed oligodendrocyte  phagocytic  and  synaptic  phagocytic  functions characteristic of normal microglia. Microglia transplanted  into  mice  brains  are  stimulated  by  Aβ  to  alter expression groups, i.e., gene expression that tends to be in an activated state [76]. However, proof of their mitigating  effects  on  AD  pathology  is  limited.  It  has  also  been shown that TREM2 expression is lower in hPSC-derived microglia  [32].  Given  that  low  TREM2  expression  was thought to have a positive effect on maintaining microglia  homeostasis,  human  pluripotent  stem  cell-derived microglia  may  help  maintain  a  stable  phenotype  that  is beneficial to remission of neuroinflammation after transplantation into the brain.\n\nAlthough  there  is  insufficient  research  on  microglia transplantation  to  treat  AD  pathogenesis,  transplanting\n\nmicroglia could theoretically help reduce harmful protein buildup from  pre-existing,  hard-to-remove  senescent microglia and help carry out typical synaptic pruning and oligodendrocyte phagocytosis. Transplantation of a single  microglia type (or equivalent precursor cell, such as a primitive macrophage progenitor cell (PMP) might not result in significant changes in AD pathology; transplantation  combining several stem cell types might be preferable. Depending on the lesion location, the appropriate subtype  of  microglia  can  be  selected  and  paired  with astrocytes or neural stem cells to more accurately reflect the environment that supports neurons in vivo.",

        "title": "Astrocyte transplantation",
        "content": "The  properties  and  activities  of  astrocytes  are  altered in many neurological illnesses, including AD, which may worsen the degenerative processes. It is well established that astrocytes can be generated from stem cells or histocytes. Transplanting astrocytes to achieve recovery of functions is regarded as one of the most promising directions for AD treatment.\n\nAt present, astrocyte transplantation therapy uses human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiated astrocytes, human  iPSC  differentiated astrocytes,  human fetal  brain-derived  astrocytes,  or  human  fetal  spinal cord-derived  astrocytes.  The  best  source  of  astrocytes is  currently  differentiation  using  stem  cells  (e.g.,  iPSCs, hESCs),  as  it  is  difficult  to  achieve  the  quantity  needed for transplantation therapy using astrocytes derived from the human fetal spinal cord and human fetal brain, which is crucial for efficacy [157].\n\nThe feasibility of transplanting astrocytes requires integration of glial cells into existing circuits. This was demonstrated  by  Zhang  et  al.  [224]  in  their  study  showing that NSC-derived glial precursor cells could differentiate into astrocytes and integrate into existing circuits in the brain after transplantation, with a survival time of more than one year. Initially proposed to treat spinal cord damage, astrocyte transplantation has been proven to protect host spinal cord neurons, encourage axonal regeneration, reduce  glutamate  toxicity,  and  support  restoration  of motor, sensory, and respiratory functions [160].\n\nThe  neurotrophic  effects  of  astrocytes,  microglia activation, and oligodendrocyte activation all support astrocyte  transplantation  for  treating  AD.  Although there are only a few  studies using  astrocytes for AD  therapy,  the  existing  research  provides  preliminary  proof  that  intracerebral  transplanted  astrocytes undergo  morphological  changes  in  response  to  Aβ deposition  and  that  this  morphology  varies  with  AD stage [101]. It has also been demonstrated that human\n\nESC-derived astrocytes stimulate the IL-4 signaling  cascade  by  controlling  the  microglia  phenotype and  serving  as  neuroprotectants,  which  is  consistent  with  previous  findings  on  the  clearance  of  Aβ  by astroglia [98, 136, 142]. As demonstrated by increased AQP4  polarization  facilitating  deposit  clearance  and improved  neuronal  function  [151],  implantation  of GPC-derived  astrocytes  was  recently  shown  to  result in long-term functional integration and sensory enhancement in elderly mice.\n\nIn addition to astrocyte transplantation alone, astrocyte transplantation has been proposed in combination with neuronal transplantation. Because astrocytes facilitate  neuronal  maturation  and  increase  synaptic  plasticity, combined cellular therapies may be advantageous for both maintaining astrocyte function and promoting neuronal differentiation [160].",

        "title": "Oligodendrocyte transplantation",
        "content": "Oligodendrocytes  are  the  core  cell  type  involved  in myelination.  They  can  be  differentiated  from  oligodendrocyte  precursor  cells  (OPC)  capable  of  migration,  expansion,  and  protecting  axons  and  neurons. The degenerative process in AD frequently involves oligodendrocyte dysfunction, which can result in further neuronal  loss  and  dysfunction.  OPC  transplantation has mainly been investigated for treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, its potential for AD treatment should  not  be  disregarded  since  OPCs  play  a  crucial role  in  remyelination  by  producing  new  oligodendrocytes to replace damaged ones and recovering lost cells after  injury.  Additionally,  the  biphasic  communication of  OPCs  with  astrocytes  makes  their  function  closely related  to  that  of  the  central  immune  system.  Theoretically,  OPCs  can  be  transplanted  alone  to  promote myelination and supporting axons, or transplanted with neurons to repair loss of functional cells in the brain.\n\nOligodendrocyte transplantation is less  common and  is  typically  intended  to  heal  neurological  impairment rather  than  to  treat  AD.  For  example,  Windrem et  al.  [217]  transplanted  human  glial  precursor  cells (hGPCs)  for  differentiation  into  oligodendrocytes  and observed myelin repair in the brain of myelin-deficient shiverer mice; the researchers thought the cells would subsequently  function  as  remyelinating  oligodendrocytes  and  be  normally  recruited.  This  study  proves that  integration  of  transplanted  GPCs  differentiated into oligodendrocytes in the brain is possible. Notably, OPC transplantation may be a more durable approach to external regeneration of oligodendrocytes due to the potential of GPCs to differentiate into other glial cells.",

        "title": "Stem cell-derived exosome therapy",
        "content": "Although  stem  cell  therapy  has  shown  superiority  over traditional drug therapy for AD, it still faces many problems. First, since stem cells have a low degree of differentiation  and  strong  ability  to  divide,  they  are  prone  to tumors. Second, intranasal administration is  often  used to administer drugs to the brain, but is challenging with stem cells.  Using  MSCs (with a diameter of 30-60 μm) as an example, the large size of stem cells may block the pulmonary capillaries and induce immune rejection [87]. Thus,  delivering  transplanted  stem  cells  to  the  brain  is challenging  and  carries  some  risk  [27,  96].  Autologous transplantation  of  MSCs  is  challenging  in  patients  with fulminant  disease  due  to  the  complex  cell  preparation process and time needed for cell transplantation [48].\n\nExosomes  derived  from  stem  cells  have  become  a promising  new  cell-free  strategy  in  the  decades-long pursuit to improve the therapeutic efficacy of stem cells. Exosomes, as a part of stem cell secretomes, are diverse membrane-bound  vesicles that function as intercellular  messengers.  They  carry  different  loads  including DNA,  RNA,  proteins,  and  lipids,  among  others.  Stem cell-derived  exosomes  show  molecular  specificity  due to  engineering  and  drug  accumulation  and  can  induce potent action mediated by the activation of factors and molecules with variable concentrations and signaling cascades. These actions can be easily modified and enriched by engineering exosomes [24].\n\nThe  physiological  roles  of  extracellular  vesicles  (EVs), which are abundant in most body fluids and released by cells. In fact, transplanted stem cells function in the body mainly due to their paracrine effect. As important parts of the stem cell secretion group, the physiological functions of exosomes are similar to those of their stem cell counterparts [153].\n\nCompared  with  stem  cell  transplantation,  exosome therapy has low immunogenicity and a lower likelihood of forming tumors. Nanoparticles (NPs) between 10 and 1000  nm  in  size  can  encapsulate  therapeutic  molecules by targeting the transport process in the CNS and then effectively  migrate  to  target  organs  after  infusion  without blocking pulmonary capillaries and causing immune rejection. Cell-secreted exosomes, which are lipid-membraned  vesicles,  can  easily  permeate  the  BBB  to  exert their  physiological  effects.  Exosome  therapy  has  also shown advantages for AD patients with acute onset.\n\nBecause  stem  cell-derived  exosomes  generally  show comparable  biological  activity  as  stem  cells  and  have many  advantages,  they  have  become  a  hot  topic  along with cell  therapy  in  the  treatment  of  neurodegenerative diseases-exosomes are believed  to  be  able  to  clear  Aβ protein in the brain, restore synaptic activity in the brain, reduce  inflammatory  responses  in  the  brain,  enhance neural network connectivity, and alter metabolism. They thus have great potential for treating a variety of diseases including AD.\n\nResearchers in Taiwan [22] Chen, et al. recently established a mouse FAD model and showed that the level of Aβ in mouse cells after  exosome  treatment  was  significantly reduced. In this experiment, exosome therapy was also  found  to  improve  glucose  metabolism  in  the  brain and restore the protein-modifying enzyme histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), representing improvement in memory and cognitive function.\n\nSome  researchers  have  improved  exosomes'  efficacy at  reducing  Aβ  in  the  brain  through  combination  with other  drugs.  [140]  used  BM-MSC-derived  exosomes  in combination  with  sphingosine  kinase  inhibitor  (SKIII) or sphingosine-1-phosphate-1 receptor blocker (VPC23019).  They  found  that  exosomes  inhibited  Aβ140,  Aβ1-42,  BACE1,  and  PS1  in  AD  mouse  cortex  and hippocampus,  thereby  improving  spatial  learning  and memory.\n\nSome studies have found that stem cell-derived exosomes have therapeutic effects on neurological function [73]. A proteomic analysis of brain tissue from AD mice  treated  with  MSC-EVs  showed  that  a  variety  of proteins  in  EVs  exert  neuroprotective,  synaptic  growth, and  neurogenesis  effects.  In  the  above  study,  EVs  were also found to have therapeutic effects on some risk genes that  can  cause  AD.  Compared  with  the  control  group, 1094 genes were upregulated and 267 genes were downregulated in the brains of AD mice after exosome treatment. Some of these upregulated genes-such as piccolo (PCLO), TENM1 ,  and  Neurite  extension  and  migration factor ( NEXMIF )-are positive for synaptic function and memory improvement, while some downregulated genes are associated with cell death, such as BAD . These results suggest  that  EVs  can  relieve  nerve  damage  and  significantly increase neurogenesis in AD mice.\n\nRegarding  inhibition  of  inflammation  in  the  brain, controlling  M1/M2  phenotypic  switching  of  microglia is  significant  for  treatment  of  AD.  Exosomes  derived from MSCs can convert from the M1 phenotype with a pro-inflammatory effect into the M2 phenotype with an anti-inflammatory  effect,  which  can  effectively  reduce neuroinflammation and relieve AD symptoms [30, 71, 96, 119].\n\nMany  previous  studies  have  used  AD  mouse  models to prove the effect of exosomes on inhibiting inflammation. However, due to differences in molecular pathways and  signaling  functions  between  rodents  and  human microglia, a research group from Stanford University [40] chose to study the role of MSC-EVs in the human microglial  cell  line  (HMC3).  They  showed  that  EV  treatment reduced the expression of CD11b in cells and the number\n\nof proteolysis and exerted an anti-inflammatory effect by promoting  M2  phenotypic  transformation  of  microglia. Notably, these results are similar to findings in AD mice.\n\nRecent  studies have shown  that  stem  cell-derived exosomes can act on astrocytes to reduce their activation, thereby reducing neuroinflammation and improving cognitive impairment in AD patients. The most intuitive use of stem cell-derived exosomes on astrocytes is to reduce the proportion of active astrocytes, which is manifested as  reduced  glial  fibrillary  acidic  protein  (GFAP)  levels in  the  brain  and  colocalization  of  GFAP  and  amyloid plaques [22] [24, 137, 215, 216])\n\nSome  findings  for  stem  cell-derived  exosomes  in  AD therapy over the last five years are listed below (Table 2):",

        "content": "Although  human  iPSCs  have  become  a  powerful  tool for  human  disease  modeling  and  have  great  potential for  translational  research  in  target  discovery  and  drug development,  various  challenges  remain.  Human  iPSCderived neurons are sensitive and require extended culture time (80 days) to develop mature neuronal features; it is challenging to do this consistently and at a large scale by manually changing the culture medium [111]. Several strategies exist to overcome these challenges. Notch and γ-secretase  inhibitors  have  been  shown  to  shorten  the maturation  period  of  most  neuronal  cell  types  [13,  20]. Another approach includes overexpression of neuro-specific genes. For example, overexpression of Ngn2 accelerates the generation of forebrain and motor neuron cells to within 10 days [52, 56]. In addition to shortening the time,  the  use  of  a  high-throughput  screening  platform for  aged  neurons  may  be  more  translatable.  Although scientists  have  differentiated  stem  cells  into  neurons, these  neurons  are  functionally  immature-similar  to embryonic or early postnatal neurons. The limited maturity  of  neurons  obtained  using  stem  cell  culture  techniques diminishes their potential for neurodegeneration research. However, recent studies have found that differentiating human iPSCs into motor and cortical neurons and then culturing them on synthetic nanofiber coatings with  high  internal  supramolecular  motion  can  enrich them into more mature neurons [2]. Furthermore, since sAD is influenced not only by risk genes but also epigenetics,  aging  and  environmental  factors  may  contribute to  its  development. The ability of iPSC models to accurately  mimic  the  sAD  phenotype  is  another  challenge in  disease  modeling  and  is  thought  to  be  an  important reason why numerous AD therapies effective in preclinical trials have poor clinical outcomes [33]. The development of more effective sAD models is thus an important goal for the future.\n\nCompared  to  2D  culture  systems,  3D  culture  platforms  are  better  suited  to  study  AD  pathophysiological mechanisms  involving  cell-cell  interactions,  controlled flow dynamics, circulating blood cells, and brain-specific microenvironments  [100].  However,  they  still  cannot mimic the intrinsic immune rejection reactions encountered  in  practical  clinical  applications.  There  are  also many  technical  challenges  facing  organoid  culture  and microfluidic technology. For example, human brain organoids lack the vasculature of brain tissue in vivo, which plays  a  facilitating  role  for  both  nutritional  supply  and neuronal cell differentiation. This lack of vascularity leads to  necrosis  in  brain-like  organ  centers,  further  interfering  with  normal  development  and  neuronal  migration routes. Although co-culture with vascular stem cells provides  a  partial  solution  to  these  problems,  the  issues  of nutrient  supply  and  the  true  blood  microenvironment remain. hESCs expressing human ETS variant 2 (ETV2) have  been  used  to  successfully  construct  brain  cortical organoids (hCOs) with vascular-like structures, including tight  junctions,  increased  expression  of  nutrient  transport  proteins,  and  transendothelial  resistance,  thereby addressing  the  challenge  of  missing  blood  vessels  [17]. However, further development is needed for their application in neurodegenerative disease. Regarding microfluidic technology, the requirements for reagent volume and reaction conditions are so stringent that small changes in the volume of reaction components can lead to changes in  the  results  [118].  Therefore,  the  clinical  usefulness  of this method needs to be further explored.\n\nFor drug screening, it is extremely important to select the appropriate early-onset predominant phenotype as a marker to measure the effect of the tested drug. In AD, the dominance of tau hyperphosphorylation or Aβ aberrant  deposition  phenotypes  has  still  not  been  elucidated.  As  a  result,  extensive  mechanistic  studies  are needed  before  applying  the  findings  to  drug  screening [21]. Since neurons, astrocytes, and microglia are highly specialized and disease-relevant cell types, the long time required  for  their  differentiation  limits  the  application of iPSC-derived glial cells in disease modeling and drug screening.  The  discovery  of  novel  strategies  to  promote gliogenesis is thus crucial for large-scale drug screening. Novel gene editing tools and biomolecular technologies, such  as  single-cell  RNA  sequencing,  could  also  enable more  accurate  disease  modeling  and  drug  screening processes.\n\nTo  summarize,  stem  cells  are  widely  used  in  disease modeling,  drug  screening,  and  cell  therapy  because  of\n\nTable 2 Stem cell-derived exosomes for AD treatment\n\n| Results at the

By  using  stem  cell-based platforms, AD research can better study the fundamental  biological  mechanisms  of  the  disease,  develop  new technologies,  and  innovate  on  therapeutic  concepts.  In the future, interdisciplinary collaborations should be fostered to build organoids or assemble spheroids and other multicellular models of human tissues comprising diverse cell types (e.g., excitatory/inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia). This could enable rapid testing  of  genetic,  chemical,  and  environmental  perturbations  to  develop  genetic  engineering  and  genome editing tools to study the pathogenesis and treatment of the disease and develop in vivo models that more accurately  recapitulate  human  physiology.  We  must  develop multi-omics technologies, such as single cell and spatial transcriptomics,  long  read  sequencing,  next-generation proteomics,  and  other  high-throughput  cellular  phenotyping platforms. We also need to develop software, data mining,  and  machine  learning  methods  to  dissect  biological  complexity  in  aging  and  disease  and  to  perform functional and genomic analyses of multicellular models (e.g.,  bulk  or  single  cell  transcriptomic  characterization, live  cell  imaging,  and  electrophysiology)  and  chemical biology-enabled  multi-omics  or  chemical  library-based drug screening studies.",

        "content": "AD research that uses stem cell technology faces several significant  challenges.  These  include:  (1)  limited  capacity  for  self-renewal  and  differentiation  of  stem  cells,  (2) heterogeneity of stem cell populations and their derived cell types, and (3) ethical concerns surrounding the use of embryonic stem cells. However, ongoing efforts to overcome  these  limitations  hold  great  promise  for  improving the quality and  effectiveness of  stem  cell-based approaches. These efforts include: (1) the development of new techniques to promote differentiation,  (2)  preventing  pre-mature  death  of  stem  cells  and  improving  the therapeutic effect, and (3) investigating alternative, ethically  acceptable  sources  of  stem  cells.  Further  research and innovation will therefore be critical to realize the full potential of stem cell technology in the fight against AD. The development and implementation of new strategies will  improve  the  quality  and  utility  of  stem  cell-based platforms for AD research and therapy, ultimately leading to better outcomes for patients with AD and related dementias.",

        "content": "Limited capacity for self-renewal and differentiation The ability of stem cells to differentiate into specific cell types that carry out corresponding functions is frequently what determines how effective they are. As a result, inadequate differentiation  rates  or  unexpected  differentiation  can significantly  impede  therapy.  In  certain  cases,  uncontrolled  stem  cell  differentiation  can  potentially  result  in the development of tumors [12]. For these reasons, many studies using stem cells for therapeutic purposes pre-differentiate stem cells such as iPSCs into certain progenitor cells before transplantation [126]. Another factor that negatively affects stem cell therapy is the loss of beneficial properties that occur during processes such as culturing, including the differentiation potential of stem cells. The loss of these beneficial properties is partly due to traditional  culture  systems  that  do  not  accurately  reflect  the natural environment of the body. In response to this limitation, many studies aim to maximize the original properties of stem cells through methods like 3D culture or the addition of specific small molecules.\n\nLarge-scale  clinical  translation  is  also  thought  to  be hampered  by  stem  cells'  capacity  for  in  vitro  amplification.  Since  stem  cells  have  a  unique  ability  to  differentiate,  it  is  essential  that  they  maintain  their  original characteristics  during  expansion.  However,  at  present, additional generations of expansion are more suitable for small-scale  operations  in  laboratories  than  large-scale clinical applications.\n\nHeterogeneity  of  stem  cell  populations  and  their  derived cell types Other important factors affecting the efficacy of stem cells is heterogeneity [60] and derived cell types. Stem  cell  heterogeneity  is  universal,for  example,  NSCs contain  different  cell  populations  with  both  neurogenic and  gliogenic  potential  [58].  MSCs  are  inherently  heterogeneous  cell  populations,  although  the  International Society for Cellular Therapy has clear restrictions on the types and proportions of molecules expressed on their cell surfaces. Explicit quantification of differentiation capacity and cell surface molecular expression serves to reduce the possible impact of stem cell heterogeneity on efficacy. It is  well  known that stem cells derived from different tissue sources can differ in the number and type of cytokines secreted, cell proliferation capacity, immunomodulatory capacity, etc. [39, 72, 120]. Stem cell heterogeneity is also related  to  tumorigenic  potential.  Notably,  some  studies have  observed  sustained  proliferation  and  tumorigenic mass production after transplantation of hPSC neuronal derivatives in rodent models of PD [106, 107]. Stem cell heterogeneity must thus be accounted for in AD therapy research. [156] concluded that the ideal stem cell therapy for  AD would transplant cells with different differentiation potentials precisely to the corresponding functional sites to achieve overall restoration of the functional network of the brain, which relies heavily on the identifica-\n\ntion and isolation of stem cell heterogeneity. [156] Besides stem cell heterogeneity, the heterogeneity of their derived cell types can greatly affect efficacy. For example, MSCs derived from healthy controls and patients can exhibit differences in  certain  functions.  There  are  also  unresolved questions whether MSCs of the same tissue origin have different epigenetic imprints. While current research on stem  cells  and  heterogeneity  of  origin  has  focused  on tumor therapy, we believe it is also valuable to consider this  issue  in  the  context  of  neural  stem  cell  use  for  AD therapy. First, identifying and isolating subpopulations of neural stem cells in different states or with different differentiation potentials can both help determine the precise efficacy of specific subpopulations of stem cells and provide more possibilities for precise AD treatment. Second, emphasis  on  stem  cell  source  heterogeneity  could  lead to better quality control of stem cells used for treatment, which in turn will provide assurance of efficacy.\n\nEthical and safety concerns surrounding the use of embryonic  stem  cells  and  cerebral  organoids Ethical  issues have been widely discussed along with the development of stem cell technology, most of which are regarding the sources  of  stem  cells.  In  the  development  of  therapies using  hESCs,  the  rationale  of  destroying  early  human embryos to treat diseases is controversial. Other current ethical issues concern the unlimited differentiation potential  of  iPSCs,  which  might  be  used  for  human  cloning and thus the generation of human-animal chimeras and human embryos [133]. It is worth noting that human-animal chimeras are one of the most promising research platforms for AD pathology research. However, these models have been ethically questioned due to their similarity to the human brain. The crucial question is: does this technology have the potential to produce a human-like mind? Although the likelihood of human brain-like organs generating  consciousness  is  currently  considered  minimal, we  cannot  exclude  the  possibility  of  future  brain-like organs  developing  consciousness.  To  better  understand AD pathology, we will likely need to develop more complex,  organ-like  models  that  more  accurately  reflect  the human brain. [108] concluded that although there is currently no chance that cerebral organoids may develop typical consciousness, questions surrounding the presence or absence of consciousness may plague the development of brain-like organs. We thus need more precise protocols for the production, use, and destruction of different levels of organoids that consider ethical norms and safety.\n\nAt  present,  the  primary  source  of  ESCs  is  human embryos  (blastocysts),  which  has  limited  the  development of derivative therapies and poses considerable difficulties for clinical applications because of the difficulty of mass production. Although it seems promising to use iPSCs as an alternative source of ESCs, there are safety concerns  because  of  the  genomic  instability  of  iPSCseven  with  improved  protocols  for  differentiation.  As  a result, before transplantation, many studies first promote in  vitro  differentiation  into  progenitor  cells  of  specific neuronal types. The use of iPSC-derived gametes has also raised concerns about the potential exploitation of developed  embryos,  human  nuclear  transfer,  and  the  risk  of altering natural reproduction, including the potential to derive gametes for same-sex and asexual reproduction.",

        "content": "The process of differentiation in vivo , which is thought to play a significant role in efficacy, occurs in a variety of stem  cell  therapies,  regardless  of  whether  the  cells  are anticipated to differentiate into the target neuronal type in vivo or are infused after initial differentiation in vitro. The  recent  discovery  that  chiral  small  molecules  promote stem cell differentiation in vivo has provided a new idea for improving the efficacy of stem cell therapy: coadministration  of  small  molecules  that  encourage  stem cell  differentiation  [110].  Observed  that,  when  exposed to  near-infrared  light,  nanoparticles  with  strong  chirality can significantly speed up the differentiation of mouse NSCs  into  neurons.  This  finding  suggests  that  strong chiral nanomaterials may be utilized to direct cell development and improve differentiation to achieve better efficacy in stem cell therapy. The use of near-infrared light might  also  lead  to  better  control  of  the  pro-differentiation effect [110].\n\nFurthermore,  [104]  demonstrated  that  nanoparticle assemblies  exerted  circularly  polarized  light-dependent forces  on  the  cytoskeleton  and  that  light-induced  periodic  mechanical  deformation  of  actin  nanofibers  at  a frequency  of  50  Hz  stimulated  neural  stem  cell  differentiation  into  a  neuronal  phenotype.  When  implanted in the hippocampus of a mouse AD model, neural stem cells irradiated according to a polarity-optimized scheme substantially reduced the formation of amyloid plaques.\n\nThese  findings  provide  novel  ideas  for  improving  the efficacy  of  stem  cells  and  a  reference  for  the  biological effects of circularly polarized light. Muñoz et al. [90] developed a differentiation scheme that successfully generated  basal  forebrain-like  cholinergic  neurons  (BFCN) from iPSCs using small molecule inhibitors and growth factors.  The  study  used  LDN193189  and  TGF-β  inhibitors  SB431542,  FGF-2,  SHH,  FGF-8,  BDNF,  and  NGF (separately or in combination) at different stages of differentiation  to  achieve  a  facilitative  effect  on  the  differentiation of iPSCs to BFCNs. These results also indicate that the strategy of adding small molecule inhibitors and growth factors at different periods has a regulatory effect on  stem  cell  differentiation,  providing  theoretical  support for promoting the differentiation of stem cells after transplantation.  Since  this  experiment  was  conducted in vitro, further research is needed to determine whether the  effects  extend  to  intracerebral  transplantation.  We cannot  rule  out  the  possibility  that  the  aforementioned differentiation-promoting  small  molecules  could  have unintended effects on the brain [90].",

        "title": "Pretreatment of stem cells",
        "content": "Since stem cells are sensitive to environmental changes, pretreatment is one of the most efficient strategies to change their phenotype and improve therapeutic efficiency. Stem cell transplantation can influence the number or type of surface receptors of certain types of somatic  cells,  enzyme  expression  levels,  and  secretome composition and have other effects that influence therapeutic efficacy by modifying environmental factors. Alternatively, small molecules can be added to the cell coculture medium. It has been demonstrated that cytokines (such as IL-3, IL-6, HGF, etc.) increase the expression of CXCR4,  which  in  turn  encourages  targeted  migration of  MSCs.  Hypoxic  preconditioning  is  another  method frequently  used  to  change  the  culture  environment. In  a  study  by  [146],  culture  under  hypoxic  conditions induced  an  increase  in  SDF-1/CXCR4  signaling,  which promoted MSCs migration. Similarly, [65] observed that hypoxia-induced  MSCs  had  better  viability, stronger proliferation  potential,  and  better  resistance  to  hypoxia and  reactive  oxygen  species  (ROS)  stress.  The  proliferation and viability of neural stem cells have also been shown to be enhanced by hypoxia culture [15], which is a  proven  way  to  improve  the  survival  rate  of  stem  cells after transplantation.\n\nSince transplanted neural stem cells must differentiate  to  be  therapeutic,  it  is  necessary  to  promote their  differentiation  at  the  lesion  site.  A  study  by  [86] demonstrated that, after melatonin treatment with neurosphere  culture,  an  inhibitory  effect  on  NSC  proliferation  at  a  pharmacological  concentration  (25  μM) was observed: differentiation  of  NSCs  into  neurons-as well as oligodendrocytes-was  promoted,  while differentiation  of  NSCs  into  GFAP-expressing  astrocytes was  unaffected.  Melatonin  also  enhanced  the  bioenergetic  activity  of  mitochondria  in  NSCs  and  exhibited  a dose-dependent  pattern,  suggesting  that  this  stimulation method provides energetically pertinent support for the differentiation process. Melatonin therapy thus promotes NSC differentiation and neural replacement using NSCs combining pharmacological melatonin dosages is a potential  regenerative  therapy  for  neurological  diseases. Studies  on  chemically  created  self-assembling  peptides have  also  been  performed  to  encourage  NSC  differentiation.  [26]  established  a  self-assembling peptide (DSP) that  can  spontaneously  assemble  into  ordered  nanofibers  and  contains  a  functional  structural  domain  made of  the  laminin-derived  amino  acids  Tyr-Ile-Gly-Ser-Arg (YIGSR); not only did this peptide increase cell viability in  normal  culture  conditions,  it  also  lowered  the  number of apoptotic cells induced by Aβ in vitro. NSC transplantation in AD rats treated with DSP was observed to enhance  survival  and  neuronal  differentiation  of  transplanted  NSCs;  increase  secretion  of  anti-inflammatory and  neurotrophic  factors  such  as  IL-10,  brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF),  and  insulin-like  growth  factor  1  (IGF-1);  and reduce increased expression of pro-inflammatory factors such  as  TNF-α  and  IL-1β.  These  experimental  findings are  consistent  with  the  hypothesis  that  the  biomaterial DSP ameliorates AD pathophysiology by promoting NSC graft survival and development.\n\nBrn-4  protein  in  MSCs  also  plays  a  positive  role  in treatment  of  AD,  but  miR-937  in  stem  cells  hinders translation  of  Brn-4.  Thus,  administration  of  specially pretreated  anti-miR-937  MSCs  can  contribute  to  the reduction and clearance of brain Aβ deposition [69].",

        "content": "Improving stem cell culture methods is another potential  strategy  to  improve  efficacy.  Traditional  in  vitro  2D culture  conditions  may  result  in  loss  of  stemness  and other  favorable  qualities,  as  2D  culture  mitigation  does not  accurately  represent  the  ecological  niche  of  stem cells  in  vivo.  Supporting  cells,  extracellular  matrix,  and growth factors make up the microenvironment inhabited by stem cells in vivo. In contrast, 3D culture can better simulate  intercellular  and  cell-matrix  interactions.  The natural environment of stem cells can be more accurately recreated in 3D culture and their favorable qualities can be maintained. Thus, one of the most promising methods currently being examined to support clinical translation of  stem  cells  is  3D  cultivation  technologies.  For  example,  Frith,  Thomson, and Genever (2010) performed 3D culture of MSCs and demonstrated that dynamic 3D culture promoted MSCs to form aggregates with good cell\n\nviability. This effect was attributed to the combination of 3D culture with dynamic factors like increased cell-cell contact, which has been shown to improve stem cell subdifferentiation potential. Similarly, [139] designed culture substrates with micropatterns to culture MSC multicellular  spheroids  in  3D  culture,  finding  that  this  method maintained  cell  function  and  improved  differentiation potential in the longer term.\n\nIn  conclusion,  as  3D  culture  can  better  mimic  the microenvironment of stem cells in vivo and help maintain  stemness,  it  is  of  great  value  for  advancing  clinical translation of stem cell therapies.",

        "title": "Preventing premature death of stem cells and improving therapeutic effects Encapsulation of stem cells",
        "content": "Many encapsulation approaches are designed to improve  the  low  survival  rate  and  prevent  premature death  of  stem  cells.  Hydrogel  encapsulation  followed by  medication  administration  is  a  common  technique. Hydrogel materials are biocompatible, can be safely dissolved and absorbed in vivo, can remain stem cells aggregated and increase cell viability [92, 93]. Since MSCs have superior  healing  and  anti-inflammatory  potential  when aggregated  into  spheres  for  administration,  aggregation of stem cells may support efficacy [92, 93]. Multiple studies have shown that encapsulation with hydrogel materials improves the survival as well as the function of stem cells [49, 91].\n\nHowever,  after  drug  delivery,  the  volume  of  hydrogel  molecules  may  restrict  molecule  diffusion.  This  was recently addressed by a single-cell encapsulation scheme using alginate microgels designed by [79] in which MSCs were  encapsulated  in  a  thin  layer  of  alginate  material using  a  microfluidic  approach  to  form  microgels.  The reduced  size  of  the  encapsulated  material  allowed  for improved diffusive drug transport. This method can enable  intravenous  drug  delivery.  The  half-life  of  encapsulated cells is also considerably longer than that of naked cells.\n\nAs  early  as  2016,  studies  have  shown  that  hydrogelencapsulated  stem  cells  can  be  used  to  treat  AD  mice. Other materials like DSP (a self-assembled peptide) can promote  neuroprotection  and  exert  anti-neuroinflammation  and  paracrine  effects  by  increasing  the  survival rate  and  differentiation  ratio  of  transplanted  stem  cells, thereby maximizing the therapeutic effect of NSC transplantation for AD [26].\n\nThe  potential  for  widespread  application  or  commercialization of such technology is enhanced by the fact that encapsulants can be preserved using normal cryopreservation techniques and defrosted cells have similar persistence of to freshly encapsulated cells after removing the encapsulants. [155] established a novel hydrogen-bonded\n\n(HOFs)  encapsulation  technique  for  NSCs  in  organic frameworks. They concluded that the main causes of the suboptimal  efficiency  of  transplantation  are  'stemness' loss, cell membrane damage during transplantation, and apoptosis  induced  by  oxidative  stress  after  transplantation. This study was the first to encapsulate NSCs using HOFs  and  showed  that  this  method  can  improve  NSC viability,  encourage  neurogenesis,  and  reduce  cognitive damage. Protective encapsulation of stem cells may be a viable means to prevent loss during transplantation and guarantee efficiency. [154] established a delivery strategy for  encapsulated  NSC  drugs  that  integrates  antioxidant nanoenzymes (e.g., ceria) into metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).  This  method  combines  the  antioxidant  capacity  of  nanoenzymes  with  the  effective  drug  delivery  of MOFs, resulting in lower oxidative damage to stem cells while the reactive framework releases encapsulated stem cells in the lesion area. Targeted delivery with a reactive framework  while  loading  enzymes  to  prevent  oxidative damage is instructive as a delivery route.\n\nMOFs  have  also  recently  attracted  attention  due  to their  potential  in  developing  new  AD  diagnostic  methods.  MOFs  are  assessed  by  fluorescence  and  electrochemiluminescence  (ECL)  detection  of  AD  biomarkers. Fluorescence detection of major metal ions in the brain (Zn 2 + ,   Cu 2 + ,   Fe 3 + , and   Al 3 + ) can be performed as part of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [124].\n\nIn  summary,  encapsulation  methods  and  their  modifications appear to be viable and adaptable strategies to achieve  targeted  release  of  stem  cells  and  increase  the survival  rate.  The  reactive  design  of  the  encapsulating framework  enables  targeted  release  of  stem  cells,  while the varying loads (enzymes, etc.) provide the potential to withstand  oxidative  damage.  What  is  currently  needed is to adjust the size of the formed package carriers (e.g., to  form  microgels)  with  reference  to  existing  studies  to create  an  encapsulating  vehicle  that  is  appropriate  for intravenous drug delivery while avoiding issues like vascular  blockage.  The  optimum  method  of  encapsulation should enable post-thaw use in addition to conventional cryopreservation.",

        "content": "A commonly used method to alter cellular phenotypes is  the  introduction of genes encoding specific products. At present,  many studies use viruses as vectors for this process. For stem cell therapy for neurological diseases, a  promising  option  is  to  upregulate  gene  expression  to help  localize  post-transplanted  stem  cells  to  the  lesion sire.  [152]  demonstrated  in  vitro  that  overexpression  of Wnt3a promoted  the  migration  and  neural  differentiation of MSCs through the Wnt/PCP pathway. Although in vivo experiments are needed to demonstrate whether upregulating  expression  of  this  pathway  has  the  same\n\neffect,  this  method  has  the  potential  to  promote  MSC migration to achieve better efficacy. [152]\n\nInvestigation  of  alternative,  ethically-acceptable  sources of stem cells At present, the main sources of stem cells can be grouped into four categories: embryonic tissue, fetal tissue, specific locations in adult organisms, and differentiated somatic cells after being genetically reprogrammed [7]. A significant proportion of these sources involve the destruction of embryos or fetuses, which has historically been a source of ethical controversy in stem cell therapy. Of these, only morula-derived ESCs are totipotent, i.e., can differentiate into all cell types in an organism. In contrast, stem cells from fetuses are generally pluripotent and can differentiate into a limited number of specific cell types. To circumvent the ethical issues of extracting stem cells, iPSCs seem to be a promising source of stem cells. However, there is the issue of overcoming possible immune rejection caused by allogeneic transplantation. Using a patient's own somatic cells as a source of stem cells would result in an increased time cost and is not suitable for large-scale clinical application. Currently,  adipose-derived  stem  cells  (ASCs)  are  one  of the best choices for stem cell therapy and tissue engineering due to their easy accessibility and proliferative capacity relative to BM-MSCs. In the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, ASCs have been observed to outperform various other stem cells in the secretion of trophic factors such as  BDNF. Therefore, adipose tissue appears to be a good source of stem cells for stem cell-based therapy considering ease of access, ethical issues, and overall efficacy.\n\nOvercoming  the  current  limitations  of  stem  cell  technology is crucial for the advancement of AD research and treatment.  The  improvement  and  implementation  of  new strategies will enhance the quality and utility of stem cellbased platforms for AD research and therapy, leading to better outcomes for patients with AD and related dementias.",

First, traditional EV production processes based on pricey 2D cell culture protocols require a lot of cell culture plastic, media, and space. Furthermore,  as  exosomes  are  secretory  products  of cells,  their  yield  is  low  and  they  are  difficult  to  produce on an industrial scale.

In  contrast,  3D  culture  offers  healthier  culture  conditions  and has  the  potential  to  produce  higher  EV  secretion  rates. MSC-EVs from conventional 2D monolayer cell cultures, 3D suspended droplet spheroids, and 3D aggregates were compared by Harrel et al. [48]. Their results showed that EV secretion was three-fold higher using 3D culture compared  to  2D  culture.  Thus,  an  effective  way  to  improve exosome production is by 3D culture.\n\nA recent study that treated AD mice with 3D-MSCEVs found that when 6E10 antibodies were used as the criterion to assess Aβ density, there was no significant difference  in  intracellular  levels  of  HPCs  between  the control  group  and  3D-MSC-EV  group;  however,  the levels  of  some  inflammatory  markers  in  mice's  brains were significantly reduced and behavioral experiments yielded positive results [24].\n\nChemical  molecular  interference Inducing  metabolic changes  and  other  disruptions  in  cells  through  the administration  of  chemical  molecules  can  also  impact exosome generation. By blocking both oxidative phosphorylation  and  glycolysis,  sodium  iodoacetate  (IAA) and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) were shown to effectively reduce the cellular energy charge. Exosome production can also be increased using chemicals like chloroquine, lipocalin (APN), and NH4Cl [24].\n\nEnvironmental  factors According  to  previous  studies [54,  148],  exosomes  can  be  promoted  by  hypoxia,  pH changes, and low glucose levels. EV secretion was slightly enhanced  after  moderate  hypoxic  treatment  of  MSCs (0.5-1%  oxygen),  while  no  increase  in  exosome  release was  observed  when  MSCs  were  stimulated  with  5% hypoxia, although the nature of the exosomes was altered. Many researchers are interested in acidity as a potential way to control exosome generation. A recent study demonstrated that the environmental factors of excessive acid and alkali resulted in decreased exosome formation compared to normal pH levels [24].\n\nStudies  have  also  shown  that  MSCs  in  a  hypoxic state present stronger activity, while oxygen-rich environments  lead  to  lower  stage  viability  of  MSCs.  [69] administered  hypoxic-conditioned  MSC-derived  miR21-riched  exosomes  to  APP/PS1  mice.  Their  results showed that hypoxia-treated MSCs had obvious activity,  while  upregulation  of  miR-21  enhanced  memory and reduced Aβ plaque deposition. [69]",

        "content": "Exosomes, which are a part of stem cell secretomes that differs  from  microvesicles  and  apoptotic  vesicles,  occur through  direct  germination  of  the  plasma  membrane, whose biogenesis starts with inward growth of the plasma membrane to create early endosomes. These endosomes then mature into multivesicular bodies (MVBs), including  inward  germination  through  the  endosomal  membrane, to create intraluminal vesicles (ILVs).\n\nThe  emerging  role  of  exosomes  in  AD  research  and therapy  has  created  the  need  for  their  large-scale  isolation. However, this is costly and difficult using conventional  methods  like  ultra-centrifugation.  Ultrafiltration-based exosome separation is a good substitute for  conventional  ultracentrifugation  because  it  involves a  shorter  processing  time  and  requires  no  specialized equipment. Additionally, by varying the size of the filter, ultrafiltration  enables  separation  and  collection  of  tiny extracellular vesicles of a certain particle size, including exosomes.  Tangential  flow  filtration  is  another  efficient method  to  eliminate  vesicle  blockage  caused  by  ultrafiltration  in  combination  with  pretreatment  with  protease, resulting in decreased viscosity of the fluid sample. Microfluidic devices are ideal tools for exosome separation and are beginning to achieve acceptance as superior exosome detection tools. These compact platforms make it  possible  to  process  nanovesicles  quickly  and  affordably-even in small quantities of liquid samples.\n\nA  different  technique  for  separating  exosomes  while maintaining the biological activity of isolated exosomes is volumetric exclusion (SEC). Unlike ultra-ionization  and ultrafiltration,  SEC  is  achieved  by  passive  gravity  flow with  no  effects  on  vesicle  structure  and  integrity.  High resolution  and  repeatability  are  additional  benefits  of SEC [150, 219].",

Thus,  in  further research, aging and environmental factors should be included in iPSC-based models to explore whether phenotypes occur only in patient-specific cells.\n\nTo generate cell-cell circuits of different cell types, coculture  systems,  microfluidic  chips,  and  3D  organoids containing  neurons,  glial  cells,  and  immune  cells  with complex neuronal networks mimicking the brain should be developed. Researchers need to clarify the key principles of delaying aging to reverse AD through epigenetic remodeling.  Combined  with  multi-dimensional  phenotypic  analysis  and  single-cell  transcriptome  sequencing, the interactive effects of tissue injury, inflammation, and regeneration on the structure of the nervous system and systemic vasculature,  aging,  and  immune  challenge need to  be  systematically  studied.  A  systematic  view  of AD  needs  to  be  achieved  through  complex  data  modeling. AD organoid models constructed using gene editing tools to assess the association between risk genes and disease  phenotypes  require  further  research.  Although CRISPR  has  recently  been  useful  in  gene  treatment  of AD, its applications in humans are mainly limited to cancer research.\n\nNotably, most existing attempts to treat AD with stem cells have used a single type of stem cell. Given the complexity  of  human  neural  networks,  stem  cell  transplantation  may  need  to  be  performed  in  conjunction  with small molecule drug induction. For example, in the case of neurogenesis, there is a reciprocal regulation between drug-induced regeneration and stem cell-induced regeneration, and the state of supporting cells in the environment  and  the  use  of  stem  cells  to  induce  glial  cells  for transplantation therapy also show considerable potential. Combined application of stem cells and glial cells is also a  promising direction. In the future, it seems likely that stem cell therapies will be combined with small molecule drugs (that promote neuroregeneration or regulate differentiation) or glial cell precursors. Such combination therapies can be studied accurately and efficiently using the above-described multi-level and multi-faceted models.\n\nMany  recently  developed  omics  technologies  already have clinical applications. AD is a complex disease, and its pathogenesis is caused by protein alterations as well as DNA, mRNA, and even miRNA alterations. Research on the pathogenesis and treatment of AD is thus increasingly adopting a multi-omics approach. Take stem cell-derived exosomes  as  an  example.  The  exosomes  contain  proteins, mRNAs, miRNAs, and other substances, and their\n\ncontents  can  be  changed  in  a  targeted  manner  through exosome engineering, resulting in a therapeutic effect on AD  from  a  multi-omics  perspective.  Researchers  have identified  many  proteins  that  contribute  to  neuroprotection  in  MSC-derived  exosomes,  and  many  miRNAs that can be encapsulated in exosomes-such as miR-29a, miR-126-3p,  miR-137,  miR-144-3p,  miR-188-5p,  miR425-3p,  and  miR-451a-can have therapeutic effects  on AD. Such findings represent new advancement in multiomics research in the exploration of AD mechanisms and therapeutic approaches.\n\nThe  majority  of  drugs  and  therapies  for  AD  focus on  the  late  stage  of  AD  onset,  which  is  characterized by  memory  loss  and  aphasia  that  seriously  impact  the lives  of  AD  patients  and  their  families.  Medication  for advanced AD mainly aims to alleviate symptoms, reduce clinical progression, and delay disability. However, drugs with the potential to prevent AD are being tested using stem cell-derived disease models. Stem cell models make it  possible  to  demonstrate  the  entire  disease  process, reflecting effects of environmental factors and indicators of pathogenic risks. Regular physical examinations before clinical  symptoms appear and behavioral diagnosis may indicate AD development. Stem cells and their derivative therapies may also be able to intervene at the early stages of  AD  to  provide  a  real  cure  rather  than  just  alleviate symptoms and delay progression, providing a new way of thinking about treating AD and reducing the burden of this disease on the elderly and society.\n\nThe life  sciences  have  entered  the  era  of  big  data,  big platforms,  and  big  discoveries.  Big  data  technology  has greatly  enhanced  the  efficiency  of  research  and  biotechnology  for  the  treatment  of  AD.  Modern  software, machine learning, and comprehensive data analysis methods  can  aid  in  the  analysis  of  complex  biological processes involved in aging and disease and help evaluate the efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions and  cell  or  cell-derived  exosome  therapies.  Thus,  interdisciplinary collaborations between researchers from different fields are crucial.\n\nPersonalized medicine and precision medicine of biomarker development have also radically changed the conventional  paradigm  of  disease  diagnosis  and  treatment, resulting in transformation of the pharmaceutical industry in the field of AD. Stem cells and regenerative medicine  have  opened  up  new  paths  for  disease  treatment. Novel research methods, such as single-cell technology, directed proteomics technology, genome editing technology, and optogenetics technology, have enabled exploration of AD in a more precise and real-time manner.\n\nIn conclusion, stem cell technology has the potential to significantly advance the understanding and treatment of AD by providing new disease models, drug development opportunities,  and  cell  therapy  options.  In  the  future, stem  cell  technology  will  develop  in  the  direction  of informatization, manipulation, and multi-omics and play a positive role at different levels to achieve better therapeutic results for AD.",

Only 5% of EOAD patients are carrying a pathogenic mutation in one of the AD genes or a apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) risk allele ε 4, most of EOAD patients remain unexplained. Here, we aimed at summarizing the current knowledge of EOAD genetics and its role in ongoing approaches to understand the biology of AD and disease symptomatology as well as developing new therapeutics. Next, we explored the possible molecular mechanisms that might underlie the missing genetic etiology of EOAD and discussed how the use of massive parallel sequencing technologies triggered novel gene discoveries. To conclude, we commented on the relevance of reinvestigating EOAD patients as a means to explore potential new avenues for translational research and therapeutic discoveries. /C211 2016TheAuthors.Publishedby ElsevierInc.on behalf of the Alzheimer's Association.

        "content": "The term dementia is used to define a heterogeneous group of progressive and degenerative brain pathologies, clinically characterized by deterioration in memory, learning, orientation, language, comprehension, and judgment. AD (OMIM# 104300), in its typical clinical presentation with progressive loss of memory and disturbance of additional cognitive functions namely word-finding, spatial cognition, reasoning, judgment, and problem solving [1], is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly. Of all dementia patients, 50% to 75% present with AD, which affects between 23 and 35 million people worldwide [2]. Age is the most prominent biological risk factor [3], and the age of 65 years is often used to classify AD patients in earlyonset (EOAD) and late-onset (LOAD) groups. Of all AD patients, around 10% are diagnosed with EOAD [4], and they present with their first symptoms between 30 and 65 years\n\n*Corresponding author. Tel.: 1 32 3 265 1101; Fax 1 32 3 265 1113.

Besides the typical clinical presentation with memory impairment, atypical clinical presentation with focal cortical symptoms, for example, visual dysfunction, apraxia, dyscalculia, fluent and non-fluent aphasia, executive dysfunction, has also been reported. This atypical presentation is more frequently reported in EOAD patients compared to LOAD, who mostly present with typical memory phenotype [5]. Additionally, a nonmemory phenotype is seen in roughly 25% of EOAD patients in whom visual or apraxic and language phenotypes are more frequent [5].\n\nThe neuropathologic hallmarks of AD brains are extracellular accumulation of diffuse and neuritic amyloid plaques, composed of amyloidb (A b ) peptide, and frequently surrounded by dystrophic neurites and the intraneuronal accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated protein tau (p-tau) [6,7]. These pathologic features are accompanied by gliosis and the loss of neurons and synapses [7]. Although, some studies reported a larger neuropathologic burden [8] or a more widespread pathology extending outside the medial temporal lobe in younger patients [5], overall the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npathologic features of EOAD and LOAD patients are largely similar, indicating that at the end-stage of disease, it is difficult to distinguish the two AD age groups by any other criterion than onset age.\n\nThe main incentive for this review was the recent renewed interest in EOAD genetic studies due to the availability of high-throughput, genome-sequencing and exome-sequencing technologies, and bioinformatic tools, permitting new attempts to unravel the missing genetic etiology of EOAD. The expectations are that these new genetic approaches will uncover new molecular pathways or new molecular components of already known pathways. Furthermore, the availability of new genetic markers will help refining the different genetic signatures of clinical AD, allowing a more accurate stratification of patient cohorts, preclinical and clinical, for medical research, and for clinical trials. In the long term, the ability to identify different underlying molecular pathologies of clinical AD patients or at risk individuals will pave the way for personalized medicine and health care.",

Between 35 to 60% of EOAD patients have at least one affected first-degree relative [11-13], and in 10% to 15% of those familial EOAD patients, the mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant transmission [11,13].

        "content": "Down syndrome (DS), caused by chromosome 21 (partial) trisomy, played a pivotal role in the early attempts to identify genes for inherited EOAD. DS patients were shown to present with a comparable brain pathology of amyloid plaques and tau tangles as AD patients [14]. The strong homology between the amyloid b (A b ) protein peptides, isolated from vessels [15] and from plaques [16] from DS and AD brains, was a first indication that both diseases shared a common genetic mechanism associated with chromosome 21 [15,17]. Whole-genome-linkage (WGL) studies in AD families provided supporting evidence for a genetic defect located on chromosome 21q [18-20]. Cloning of the gene coding for the amyloid b precursor protein (APP) [21], from which the amyloid b peptides are produced, and its mapping to chromosome 21q21.2-21q21.3 [22,23], encouraged a series of genetic studies aiming at identifying mutations in AD patients and families. Initial genetic studies in large families with autosomal dominant AD were negative [24,25] but could be explained by the observation of a high degree of genetic heterogeneity in familial AD indicating that genes other than APP had to be involved [26].\n\nA segregation study in extended multigenerational families with autosomal dominant cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis Dutch type (HCHWA-D), conclusively linked APP to the disease [27]. HCHWA-D brain pathology consists mainly of vascular amyloid depositions of the same A b observed in AD brains [28]. Sequencing identified a mutation affecting the A b sequence in patients with HCHWA-D [29] and segregated with disease [30]. The discovery of a APP mutation linked to vascular A b pathology in HCHWA-D encouraged new mutation studies of APP in AD families. A first mutation was identified confirming a direct role for APP in AD pathogenesis in some AD families [31].\n\nSegregation studies in EOAD pedigrees, negative for APP mutations, led to the identification of a new locus for EOAD on chromosome 14q24.3 [32-35]. Genetic mapping and gene cloning followed by mutation screening of candidate genes [36-38] identified presenilin 1 ( PSEN1 ) as an EOAD gene with at that time unknown functions [39]. Based on protein homology, a second presenilin protein was identified and mapped to chromosome 1q31-q42 [40,41], in the region that was linked to AD in a series of families known as descendants of Volga-Germans [42,43] and was named presenilin 2 ( PSEN2 ).",

        "content": "To date, 52 pathogenic mutations in APP have been reported in 119 probands of autosomal dominant families (http://www.molgen.vib-ua.be/ADMutations) [44]. Most of the APP mutations are nonsynonymous within or flanking the A b sequence (Fig. 1A). However, 25 genomic duplications of variable size containing APP have been identified co-segregating with AD in as many autosomal dominant families, as reported in http://www.molgen. vib-ua.be/ADMutations [44] and reviewed in [45], mimicking partial trisomy 21. Furthermore, a recessive one amino acid deletion (p.E693 D ) [46] and a recessive missense mutation with dominant negative effect on amyloidogenesis (p.A673V) [47,48] were described (Table 1). Missense mutations are identified at least 4-folds more frequently than APP genomic duplications in AD patients. Disease onset of APP mutation carriers ranged between 45 and 60 years [49,50]. In contrast to the missense mutations, showing a near-complete disease penetrance, APP genomic duplications display reduced penetrance and higher variability in onset age [45]. Besides the pathogenic mutations, a rare protective variant p.A673T in APP was reported that was enriched in the Icelandic population [51]. At the same amino acid position, the p.A673V variant showed\n\nFig. 1. APP protein mutations and structure.

In PSEN2 , 31 mutations have been identified, 15 pathogenic in 24 probands and 16 with pathogenicity nature unclear (Fig. 2B). The mutation spectrum of the PSEN genes includes missense mutations, small insertions, and deletions (indels) as well as genomic deletions specifically in PSEN1 , which lead to inframe exon 9 skipping (http://www.molgen.vib-ua.be/ ADMutations) [44] (Table 1). The onset age of carriers of a PSEN1 mutation ranged from 30 to 50 years. PSEN2 mutation carriers have generally a wider onset age range from 40 to 70 years [49,50]. With a few exceptions, disease penetrance is complete for PSEN1 mutations [50]. In case of PSEN2 mutations, disease penetrance is more difficult to establish because far less families have been reported and the onset age range is much wider [50]. PSEN mutations are commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, but de novo mutations in PSEN1 have been described in EOAD patients with disease onset as early as 28 years [52,53].\n\nTwo families have been described that segregate dominant EOAD mutations in a homozygous state, a Italian family with the APP mutation p.A713T [54] and a Colombian family with the PSEN1 mutation p.E280A [55].

The major implication of these findings is that the homozygous state of autosomal dominant mutations in AD is not lethal as initially hypothesized. This may also suggest the possible presence of additional protective genetic factors, which may modify the disease presentation.\n\nIn an EOAD patient cohort, the estimated mutation frequencies for the three genes were , 1% for APP , 6% for PSEN1 , and 1% for PSEN2 [56]. Together, they explain only 5%-10% of EOAD patients [9,56], whereas depending on the study, 23% to 88.2% of autosomal dominant patients remain genetically unexplained [9,11,57-59] (Fig. 3). The wide divergences in unexplained EOADpatients and families might result from differences in study design or sampling biases. Besides the genetic heterogeneity, phenotypic heterogeneity is also reported in EOAD. This complicates the clinical diagnosis in younger patients. Atypical presentation with language impairment was reported for specific PSEN1 mutations [49,50]. Prominent behavioral symptoms (also presenting symptoms) like delusion, hallucinations, and apathy, are described for a subset of PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutations [49,50]. In some cases, the clinical symptoms fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia, for example, in the case of the PSEN1 mutation p.G183V. In this specific example, the autoptic pathologic and immunohistochemistry analysis of the brain showed pick-type tauopathy, normally caused by MAPT mutations, in absence of extracellular A b deposits [60]. The neurologic symptom of myoclonus is present in most of monogenic EOAD patients and increases with the disease duration; seizures were also reported as presenting symptom for some PSEN1 mutations and are very common in APP duplication carriers (including Down syndrome patients) [49,50]. Extrapyramidal symptoms are not uncommon in PSEN1 mutations carriers but very rare for PSEN2 and APP and tend to appear after several years into the disease course [49,50]. Spastic paraparesis has been associated with specific PSEN1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRNA-Seq\n\nFig. 3. Missing genetic etiology of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). The pie charts indicate the distribution of EOAD and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) patients (dark blue), the fraction of sporadic and familial EOAD patients with the sub-fraction of autosomal dominant patients (light emerald). The orange pie chart depicts the fraction of unexplained autosomal dominant families. The possible mechanisms that may explain the missing genetic etiology of EOADare divided in two groups arising from the red pie chart: (1) possible undetected genetic alterations due to different causes, listed arising from the red pie chart (right side) and (2) possible undetected epigenetic dysregulation (left side). For both scenarios, some examples of study designs (e.g., family based, extreme trait design and so forth or investigation of DNA(de) methylation and so forth) and technological approaches such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), chromatin immunoprecipitation assay combined with sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) are schematically suggested.\n\nmutations; in these cases, a peculiar pathologic finding of A b plaques without a dense core or neuritic dystrophy ('cotton wool plaques') is reported in the frontal cortex of the patients presenting the phenotype [61]. Cerebellar ataxia is a rare event but is present for specific PSEN1 mutations, like in the case of the p.S170F mutation co-segregating with a Cathepsin D variant, suggesting a deleterious epistatic effect on the disease course [62]. Taken together, this indicates that it is reasonable to continue efforts to both unravel the genetic etiology of EOAD and to search for modifier of the phenotype in presence of known pathogenic mutations.",

The presence of one or two copies of the APOE ε 4 allele increased the risk to develop LOAD by a factor 3 up to 15-fold in a dose-dependent manner [66,67].\n\nThe APOE ε 4 allele also increased risk for EOAD in carriers of at least one ε 4 allele and was highest in those with a positive family history (Table 2) [12]. In carriers, the homozygosity for the APOE ε 4 allele was sufficient to significantly increase risk for EOAD independent of other genetic factors. In contrast, in carriers, heterozygous for the APOE ε 4 allele risk was only significantly increased in the presence of a positive family history of disease, indicating that the presence of one ε 4 allele was insufficient to increase risk for AD before the age of 65 years. It also suggested that the APOE ε 4 allele may modify the expression of other genetic factors contributing to disease. However,\n\nfamilial aggregation of EOAD cannot fully be explained by APOE as both carriers and noncarriers of a ε 4 allele have an increased risk in the presence of a positive family history. Contrary to the risk-increasing effect of the APOE ε 4 allele, it was demonstrated that the ε 2 allele exerted a protective effect [72,73]. Different from the mutations in APP , PSEN1 , and PSEN2 , the APOE ε 4 allele was considered neither necessary nor sufficient to cause AD. However, this concept might need to be reconsidered based on a more recent study [78], which showed that the effect of APOE on AD risk is comparable to the effect of a major genetic factor with semidominant inheritance [78].\n\nAnalysis of the APOE genotypes in families segregating dominant APP (p.V717I) [79], PSEN1 (p.E280A) [70], or PSEN2 (p.N141I) mutations, showed that onset age decreased in presence of the ε 4 allele in mutation carriers, whereas those with the ε 2 allele had later onset ages [70,71]. A larger study of samples of the PSEN1 (p.E280A) family [73] confirmed the APOE ε 4 allele as an age-at-onset (AAO) modifier ( w 12 years of delay) compared to the ε 4 allele (Table 2) [73]. Nevertheless, these APOE genotype effects were not observed in all families with a pathogenic mutation [90]. Genome-wide searches in the Volga German families (P SEN2 p.N141I) identified at least three additional genetic loci (1q23.3, 17p13.2, and 7q33) [91], which could harbor modifier genes. Furthermore, a whole genome-sequencing approach of a large Colombian kindred ( PSEN1 p.E280A), detected a protective variant (p.A23T, rs1129844) in the gene CCL11 encoding eotaxin-1 that delayed onset age of AD by a decade [74]. Autosomal dominant families, segregating mutations in one of the 3 causal EOAD genes, show often variability in clinical presentation, even in the presence of the same mutation. A meta-analysis study showed that the phenotypic heterogeneity could be partially explained by the mutated gene, the type of mutation, and the family history. But, this is not always the case, indicating that in certain families, additional modifier factors (i.e., gene-gene and geneenvironment interactions) may be involved [90].",

        "content": "APP and its processed peptides are the cornerstone of the 'amyloid cascade hypothesis' [92]. This hypothesis states that the accumulation of A b is the causative agent of AD by destroying the synapses, inducing the formation of NFTs, and ultimately inducing neuronal loss [92]. Two distinct and mutually exclusive pathways cleave APP (Fig. 1B). In one pathway, the cleavage by a -secretase and g -secretase produces three fragments: a secreted C-terminal fragment (sAPP a ), p3, and the APP intracellular domain (AICD; Fig. 1B). In the second, and thus amyloidogenic pathway, APP is cleaved by the b -secretase (beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1, BACE1), followed by g -secretase cleavage. The cleavage by b -secretase generates a large soluble extracellular secreted domain (sAPP b ). The remaining membrane bound APP fragment, C99, is processed by multiple g -secretase cleavages. The first occurs at the cleavage site epsilon ( ε -site, Fig. 1B) to produce the AICD and then, after g -secretase cleavages trim the membrane bound producing A b species that differ in protein length including A b 38, A b 40 (most common fragment), A b 42 (self-aggregative fragment), and A b 43 [93]. Genetic mutations in APP are located in or near the A b sequence and in the proximity of the cleavage sites of the secretases (Fig. 1A), whereas PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutations are scattered all over the protein (Fig. 2A and 2B). The mutations are predicted to cause AD through aberrant APP processing determining either increased A b levels or increased production of A b 42 (and A b 43) peptide over A b 40, triggering A b aggregation [93]. From its postulation, the 'amyloid cascade hypothesis' has been supported and questioned (as reviewed by Morris et al. [94]) acknowledging that A b has an important role in AD pathogenesis although its role in the disease process is most likely much more multifaceted. This was corroborated by the observation of a subgroup of clinically diagnosed AD patients with neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits but near absence of A b deposits, defined as 'suspected nonAD pathology' (SNAP) [95]. In a clinical trial of anti-A b passive immunotherapy, 16.3% of the clinically diagnosed AD patients had a negative-baseline amyloid positron emission tomography scan [96]. Studies on mild cognitive impairment cohorts are ongoing to phenotypically classify the SNAP patients [97,98], to better understand, if they represent a subgroup of AD with pathologic features independent from the amyloid cascade [99].",

        "content": "Possibly, some of the SNAP patients might be associated with mutations in genes involved in other neurodegenerative brain diseases (NBD). Mutations have been identified, at low frequencies (less than 1%-2%), in genes causing frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), that is, mutations in MAPT [83,84] and in granulin ( GRN ) [80-82], and the repeat expansion in C9orf72 [85-87] (Table 3). The genetic heterogeneity of the phenotypic presentation of AD supports that both diseases form part of an AD-FTLD disease continuum [100,101]. An AD-like phenotype was also described in the presence of a nonsense mutation in the prion protein\n\nTable 3 Genetic heterogeneity in AD: Neurodegenerative brain diseases genes presenting with AD-like phenotype\n\n| Gene    | Chromosome   | Typical phenotype   | Mutation frequency in AD (%)   | References   |\n|---------|--------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|--------------|\n| GRN     | 17q21.31     | FTLD                | , 2%                           | [80-82]      |\n| MAPT    | 17q21.31     | FTLD                | , 1%                           | [83,84]      |\n| C9orf72 | 9p21.2       | FTLD                | , 1%                           | [85-87]      |\n| PRNP    | 20p13        | Prion disease       | , 1%                           | [88,89]      |\n\n( PRNP p.Q160*) [88,89], gene responsible for inherited neurodegenerative spongiform encephalopathies. Histopathologic analysis of nonsense mutation carrier showed neuritic plaque-like pathology and severe NTFs, the plaques were immunonegative for A b but immunopositive to PrP leading to a pathological diagnosis of prion disease [88] (Table 3). Moreover, a common coding polymorphism, Methionine (M) to Valine (V) at position 129 of PRNP has been associated with EOAD when identified in homozygous state (MM and VV; Table 2) [75]. The risk was higher for the VV and increased in patients with positive family history [75]. In addition, increasing number of octapeptide repeat insertions in PRNP have also been associated with younger onset age in AD patients (Table 2) [76]. The genetic heterogeneity in some dementia patients leads to a later clinical diagnosis and to flawed genetic testing. With the current availability of massive parallel sequencing (MPS), causal genes across NBD clinical diagnostic dementia subgroups can be screened simultaneously, increasing the chances to identify pathologic mutations independent of the clinical diagnosis. It can be expected that the breadth and depth of this etiological disease heterogeneity will be clarified more fully in the coming years, as discussed in section 5 and 6.",

        "title": "5. The role of EOAD genes in AD susceptibility",
        "content": "There is substantial evidence that apart from pathogenic mutations, the EOAD genes also harbor genetic variations that contribute to increased susceptibility for AD. For example, single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the promoter region of APP or PSEN1 have been associated with increased risk of LOAD [68,69,102]. Some APP promoter SNVs, increase neuron-specific APP transcriptional activity by near two-fold [103,104], and as such increase risk to develop LOAD. PSEN1 promoter SNVs [68,69,102] could alter protein expression in neurons [69,102] leading to increased risk of both EOAD (Table 2) [68,69] and LOAD [69]. Likewise, coding variants in the known causal genes might influence AD risk; however, to date, there is little information available because causal EOAD genes are rarely screened in LOAD patients [56,105]. Moreover, in EOAD patients, the routine genetic testing paradigm was based on mutation frequency ( PSEN1 . APP . PSEN2 ) and location of known mutations (exons 16 and 17 in APP covering the A b peptide cleavages sites) and was stopped once a pathogenic mutation was identified.\n\nToday, the availability of extended gene panels and MPS technology, allows near unlimited screening of full coding sequences of multiple disease genes in parallel across clinical phenotypes ([105,106] and unpublished data). Systematic screening of EOAD and LOAD patient cohorts showed rare or novel mutations in causal AD genes in LOAD patients ([105] and unpublished data) mutations in APP outside the A b coding exons and the occurrence in one individual of mutations in more than one NBD genes (unpublished data). This suggests that mutations in known\n\nEOAD genes might act differently on disease expression, which ranges from high penetrance ( 5 causal allele) and early-onset age to low penetrance ( 5 risk allele) and lateonset age, depending on the effect of the mutant allele on protein function ([105] and unpublished data). The new challenge that we are facing when using these gene panels is the high potential of identifying variants of uncertain significance (VUSs). These VUSs lack supportive functional data and can only be classified based on their likelihood of pathogenicity using in silico information obtained using bioinformatics prediction tools (e.g., predicting the impact of the mutated amino acid residue on protein stability/function) [107], data which are insufficient in a clinical diagnostic setting.",

        "content": "Rare high-penetrant mutations in APP , PSEN1 , and PSEN2 could explain only a small fraction of EOAD families, leaving a large group of autosomal dominant pedigrees genetically unexplained [9,11,57-59] (Fig. 3). Additionally, it was estimated that only between 5%-10% of EOAD [9,56] can be explained by mutations in the three known EOAD genes (Fig. 3). The limited number of resolved pedigrees and large number of genetically unexplained EOAD patients, indicated that additional causal genes remain to be identified. Next generation sequencing technologies (NGS), like whole-genome-sequencing (WGS) and wholeexome-sequencing (WES), offered a next step to gain new insights into the molecular genetic etiology of AD. Particularly, these NGS technologies made it conceivable to reconsider those small families that had been excluded from WGL studies because of their limited genetic information content and thus lack statistical power. Additionally, it became possible to examine, in an unbiased manner, groups of unrelated AD patients selected for their extreme phenotypic characteristics, for example, very early-onset age, familial history of disease, or atypical clinical and/or neuropathological phenotypes.\n\nAn early NGS study produced WES data of a clinically diagnosed EOAD patient and identified in NOTCH3 , a known mutation that had been associated with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy [108], a dementia disorder that shares clinical similarities with EOAD. The index patient belonged to a consanguineous Turkish family with a complex clinical history of neurologic and immunologic disorders [108]. The study demonstrated that WES is a valid tool to unravel the genetic etiology of complex diseases [108]. A WES study in EOAD probands of autosomal dominant families, who were negative for mutations in the three EOAD genes, identified seven mutations on screening of 29 probands (five missense and two nonsense mutations) in the sorting protein-related receptor gene ( SORL1 ) [109]. Previous studies have shown reduced expression of the SORL1 transcript in AD patients using\n\nmicroarray screening [110] and the involvement of the protein in APP and A b trafficking [111]. One of the EOAD missense mutations in SORL1 (p.G511R) that cosegregates with autosomal dominant AD in one family [109], is located within the VPS10P domain of SORL1. This specific mutation was shown to reduce the capability of the VPS10P domain to bind A b , resulting in accumulation of the peptide and lower turnover [112]. More, the investigation of an EOAD patient-control cohort confirmed the role of rare nonsynonymous coding variants in SORL1 as risk factor for EOAD (Table 2), with the association signal driven by familial patients [77]. Also, both common and rare, noncoding and coding variants in SORL1 have been associated with increased risk of LOAD [113-115]. Three SORL1 coding mutations (p.E270K and p.T947M, p.A528T) identified in a family-based and cohort-based association study on LOAD have been shown to increase A b 40 and/or A b 42 secretion when expressed in vitro [115]. These studies reinforced the role of rare variants in SORL1 in both EOAD and LOAD risk. The screening of SORL1 in larger patient/ control groups will help defining the contribution of rare genetic variants in SORL1 to AD etiology.",

        "content": "Scarcity of sufficiently informative EOAD families, the small number of family members available for genetic analyses and the clinical and genetic heterogeneity, has hampered WGL studies in identifying the actual underlying gene defects [116]. An example is provided by the familybased WGL study in the Swedish series, which includes both EOAD and LOAD patients. The original WGL study in multiple autosomal dominant families detected a suggestive linkage at chromosome 5q35 [117]. The inclusion of additional families to the WGL analysis did not confirm the 5q35 locus [118], but the investigation of a selected number of families with autopsy confirmed AD revealed a suggestive locus on chromosome 8q24 [119]. An independent locus on chromosome 8q was identified in a Swedish family in another WGL study [120]. In the aforementioned examples, the underlying genetic defect has not yet been pinpointed. We also identified in one extended Dutch family, a significant WGL peak at chromosome 7q36 but candidate gene screening in this locus did not identify a mutation that could explain the linkage [121].\n\nToday, NGS technologies are used to examine unexplained EOAD families [122]. In large extended families, the NGS approach can be preceded by a WGL analysis to prioritize chromosomal regions that are more likely to contain the disease gene. NGS data of two, distantly related, patients can be sufficient to identify shared, protein affecting, genetic variants in genes located in the linked loci. An advantage of this combined approach of WGL and NGS is a significant decrease in complexity of the NGS data under analysis. Furthermore, the success rate of this approach can be substantially increased by including additional family members both affected and/or unaffected. The main strength of NGS technologies, however, is their capability to identify putative disease genes by direct analysis of the data obtained of related family members belonging to small nuclear families. Because of the familial nature, these NGS studies are often limiting their first analysis to variants in coding sequences, particularly variants predicted to have a high impact on the protein functioning and thus identifying high-penetrant causal mutations. But silent, noncoding and genomic variations can also exert an effect on disease risk or causality. For example, the intron 4 variant (c.358-304 C . G) in SOD1 defines the activation of a cryptic splice site with the inclusion of a pseudo-exon leading to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [123]. Also, genomic duplications of the APP locus have been linked to EOAD (as reviewed in section 2.2), and an inversion polymorphism comprising MAPT has been associated to increased risk for neurodegenerative brain diseases like progressive supranuclear palsy [124,125]. In case, a candidate gene is identified in this NGS approach, the next major step is to generate confirmatory evidence of its pathogenic role in the disease. This can be obtained by cosegregation studies of the putative disease causing mutation in the family, by the screening of the candidate gene for mutations in a patient cohort and its absence in a control cohort. Limiting factors to the segregation analysis are the size of the pedigree as well as the number of available samples. Also, incomplete or age-dependent penetrance of the genetic variants can complicate the interpretation of both the segregation data as well as the presence of the variant in control individuals.\n\nAlternatively, an extreme trait design can be used to sequence a small number of individuals at one or both extremes of the disease (endo) phenotype [126] as shown by Nho et al. [127]. This approach, though it identified frequent variants that may be associated with AD risk, provides an example of using NGS with quantifiable traits as endophenotype.",

        "content": "In most of the EOAD families, the disease inheritance is consistent with autosomal dominant transmission. Occasionally, other transmission patterns were reported like recessive mutations in APP [46,47] and de novo mutations in PSEN1 [52,53] (described in section 2.2), but they have not been systematically explored. A potential study design to optimize their detection is the use of WGS in small nuclear families or trios with neurologically healthy parents and EOAD patients negative for the APOE ε 4 allele. It is possible to approach the data analysis, based on the family history of disease, to identify either recessive (positive family history) or de novo (negative family history) mutations. In specific cases, that is, when the family history is unknown, both hypotheses can be\n\nfollowed in parallel. The WGS data of the affected offspring can be used to define a genome-wide map of runs of homozygosity (ROH), and these ROH regions can be analyzed together with the WGS data of the parents to identify recessive mutations. Recessive inheritance of AD has already been examined before using either polymorphic simple-tandem-repeat markers or high-density single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping arrays, identifying homozygous regions harboring potential candidate genes [128-131]. Conversely, the WGS data can be analyzed for de novo mutations present in the offspring but absent in the parents. Limitations to these study designs are the unavailability of both parents and, the possibility that EOAD in the offspring resulted from a dominant mutation that was undetected in the parent due to incomplete penetrance or an AAO modifier. Alternative to recessive or de novo mutations, sporadic EOAD patients can also be explained by germline or somatic mosaicism [132,133] as shown for the PSEN1 p.P436Q mutation [132], with the degree of mosaicism affecting onset age and clinical presentation. Also, epigenetic dysregulation can affect gene expression in AD. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (de)methylation, chromatin remodeling, and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) expression could play a more impacting role than initially thought in AD onset and expression (Fig. 3). Alteration in methylation in the promoter region of APP , PSEN1 , and APOE have been described in AD patients as well as histone acetylation which was altered in both AD patients and in AD transgenic mouse models (as reviewed by Lardenoije et al., [134]). Imbalanced expression of noncoding RNAs, miRNA particularly, has been identified in relation to AD (as reviewed by van den Hove et al. [135]). These mechanisms affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence and are currently underinvestigated in EOAD patients. Two epigenetic studies in LOAD [136,137], adopted novel designs to control for confounding factors like the different methylation pattern in different cells/tissues, interindividual variability within the same tissue [138]. Both studies independently detected changes in methylation in four CpG sites close to ANK1 , RPL13 , CDH23 , and RHBDF2 [136,137]. This confirmed the respective findings and supported the strength of the study designs. Additionally, the recent availability of the epigenome roadmap [139], a public data resource containing epigenetic information from different cell types and tissues, is paving the way to more comprehensive research. This effort resulted, among others, in the identification of conserved epigenomic signals at orthologous regions between mice and humans, which upregulate the immune response genes and downregulate the synaptic plasticity genes in the CKp25 mouse model of AD [140]. The major challenge of this type of studies, in the years to come, will be to determine whether the epigenetic change is a cause or a consequence of the disease and how the disease risk is influenced by the alteration of the chromatin structure\n\n[141]. Moreover, it will be relevant to comprehend how the epigenome signature varies between populations and how the epigenetic findings will translate from mouse models (e.g., CK-p25) to humans. The availability of epigenome data will allow the integration of genetic results with epigenome regulation to better understand disease signatures which may represent a potential target for future diagnostic and treatment interventions.",

On the other hand, an international effort is ongoing to better understand the temporal sequence and the earliest events, which lead to the endpoint disease clinical manifestation. Longitudinal studies on families segregating a monogenic form of AD and patients with a known causal mutation are currently performed to investigate the prodromal phase of the neurodegenerative processes which ultimately lead to AD [142]. The understanding of the post-genomic consequences of the genetic mutations aims at improving the AD diagnosis through the identification of novel sensitive biomarkers (Box 1), which correlate with earliest pathologic events and with disease conversion and progression. This will also help in the definition of targets for therapeutic screening and the selection of uniform patients groups for targeted pharmaceutical approaches. Longitudinal studies in asymptomatic mutation carriers have already demonstrated that at least 20 years before the clinical manifestation of cognitive deficits it is possible to detect the pathologic changes happening in the brain using both biochemical and instrumental biomarkers (Box 1) [142,144]. The longitudinal data investigation of cognitively unimpaired mutations carriers from the Colombian PSEN1 kindred included in the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative (API), for example, led to the identification of a composite cognitive test score that has improved power to detect preclinical AD decline [150]. A direct application of this score could be in identifying preclinical patients to include in prevention trials [150]. In the API cohort, the anti-A b monoclonal antibody crenezumab testing is ongoing [151]. Another example of translational research is provided by the dominantly inherited Alzheimer's network trials unit, which is currently testing in presymptomatic known mutation carriers two monoclonal anti-A b antibodies (gantenerumab and solanezumab) that target different A b species [151]. A b 42-reducing approaches may have more efficacy in familial patients, because the increased production of A b 42 is caused by genetic mutations, in this way, it is possible to attempt to increase the clearance of the toxic peptide before the accumulation is too extensive.

NGStechnologies are sequencing in parallel the entire coding sequence of all three causal genes either by gene-panels approach [106] or by whole-exome sequencing [143].\n\nSpecific (or core) biochemical markers are A b 42 , total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau). These are dosed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on lumbar puncture. These biomarkers are measured to provide a reflection of the cerebral metabolic process of the protein transport between the brain and the CSF. General consensus is that in AD patients, the CSF levels of A b 42 are reduced, because of amyloid plaque formation in the brain, and that t-tau and p-tau are increased because of neuronal cell loss [144,145]. Furthermore, t-tau CSF levels increase with AD progression [145]. The better understanding of the pathologic processes occurring in AD brains are triggering the validation of novel CSF biomarkers (as reviewed in [146]) as the APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) levels, the dosage of truncated amyloidb isoforms, both linked to amyloidogenesis and result increased in patients. APP cleavage products, which are produced during APP processing can be measured to assess drug efficacy.\n\nF2-isoprostane a marker of mithocandrial dysfunction as well as markers of synaptic degeneration (e.g., synaptotagmin, synapsin, synaptophysin and so forth) and markers of brain injury (i.e., visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1) [147]), are under investigation to assess their applicability in diagnostic.\n\nNeuroanatomic markers such as computer-assisted tomography (CT) and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to measure structural brain atrophy. Alteration in brain metabolic processed are measured using metabolic markers, that is, positronemission tomography and single photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) with radiopharmaceutical agents, for example, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). It is also possible to image in vivo amyloid deposition, imaged by PET with the use of Pittsburgh compound B (PiB). A recent study shows that also tau tangles correlate well with AD diagnosis, showing the strongest predictive value for progression to AD [148]. Although tau is a biomarker of brain injury, synapse loss, and progression to neurodegeneration, selective tau tracers for PET are not yet available [149]. In vivo tau imaging will help in clarifying the role of tau in AD onset and progression and will support the clinical disease diagnosis [149].\n\nmutation are still in the central core of preclinical and clinical research. The knowledge of the molecular and cellular biology of AD has already supported the development of tools for disease diagnosis (Box 1), but efforts are still ongoing to identify novel biomarkers for disease prediction and prognosis.

        "content": "Locus heterogeneity and limitations in both pedigree size and technologies were probably the major contributors to the lack of additional genetic breakthroughs in EOAD. Meanwhile, the investigation of LOAD, using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), led to the identification of common risk variants within . 20 genetic loci [114,152-156]. These genetic loci could be grouped in three major biological pathways: immune system; lipid metabolism; and synaptic dysfunction/cell membrane processes (e.g., endocytosis) [116,157,158]. Additionally, NGS resequencing efforts are identifying rare variants (minor allele frequency , 1% in the general population) with a strong effect on disease risk in additional genes or in genes previously associated with LOAD. Examples are provided by rare variants detected in TREM2 [159,160] or ABCA7 [161,162]. Also, in these cases, the main pathways involved are the immune response ( TREM2 , ABCA7 ) and lipid metabolism ( ABCA7 ) [157]. As\n\nfor APOE ε 4 (discussed in section 2.3), a few rare variants in the risk genes (e.g., TREM2 [163], ABCA7 [162], EPHA1 [164]) have been shown segregating in families, suggesting a possible effect on disease penetrance, although further studies are needed to strengthen this hypothesis. The role of rare variants in EOAD has been less investigated nonetheless a few examples are available like the rare protective variant detected in APP [51] and the variant in CCL11 (eotaxin-1) [74]. This last example is of particular relevance, as it demonstrated an involvement of the immune pathway in modulating the disease onset in presence of a highly penetrant mutation in PSEN1 . The molecular mechanism through which eotaxin-1 modulates AD onset needs further investigation but, if validated, may represent a first step to develop therapies able to delay the onset of AD. This finding also supports the hypothesis that rare variants can modulate the disease onset and most likely also the disease progression. Taken together, the findings suggest that A b processing in LOAD could have a lesser central role, whereas the clearance of the aggregates might be involved in the disease pathogenesis [165].\n\nOn the one hand, the identification in EOAD of AAO disease modifiers ( APOE : lipid metabolism and CCL11 : immune pathway) in genes belonging to two of the biological pathways detected by GWAS in LOAD, is indicative of multiple (common) pathways modulating the clinical expression of AD. On the other hand, the shared clinical features as well as the pathologic findings in brain tissue of both EOAD and LOAD suggest that discoveries obtained in EOAD will likely translate to LOAD.",

This can be gene hunting projects or trials for biomarkers selection or compound testing, paving the way to personalized medicine.\n\nIn parallel to the deep genetic profiling of patients cohorts, the longitudinal follow-up of families with known mutations will provide additional insights in the known disease process that could have implications for diagnostics, for the development of predictive tests, and for clinical trial design. In a future prospective, the integration of NGS with data coming from other-omics analysis (i.e., epigenomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics), might lead to the identification of molecular disease signatures, identifying pattern(s) of altered protein expression that are better able to discriminate early disease stages and facilitate the identification of novel causal proteins and pathways or to prioritize genes and proteins as 'druggable' molecular targets for novel therapeutic approaches. In conclusion, tremendous progresses have been made in the last years in disclosing the pathologic mechanisms of AD. Novel regulatory mechanism and biological pathways have been disclosed, but prevention of the disease is still a challenge ahead. In this review, we have summarized the main aspects of the research in EOAD and how these have influenced the current knowledge of the disease mechanisms. We suggest that continuation of the investigations of families segregating known mutations and the elucidation of the missing genetic etiology in unexplained EOAD patients still has a vast potential to deliver novel crucial pieces that will lead to a better understanding of the complex puzzle of AD at large.",

        "content": "1. Systematic review: PubMed search, meeting abstracts and presentations, were used to collect information concerning Alzheimer's disease (AD). The search focus was on the genetics of early-onset AD (EOAD), on the application of high-throughput sequencing technologies and on ongoing translational studies on EOAD.\n2. Interpretation: We provide a comprehensive review on EOAD genetics. Despite the tremendous advance in the field, a large part of the EOAD patients is still unexplained. Thus, possible molecular mechanisms that might underlie the missing genetic etiology of EOAD are explored.\n3. Future directions: The basis of the current knowledge of AD is derived from genetic studies on large EOAD pedigrees in the early 90s. Here, we suggest that the use of high-throughput sequencing technologies applied to EOAD patients has a vast potential to deliver crucial information to help in better understanding the molecular mechanisms of AD in general.",

This is partly due to insulin resistance in the brain. Insulin signaling and the number of insulin receptors may decline in the brain of T2DM patients, resulting in impaired synaptic formation, neuronal plasticity, and mitochondrial metabolism. In AD patients, hypometabolism of glucose in the brain is observed before the onset of symptoms. Amyloidβ accumulation, a main pathology of AD, also relates to impaired insulin action and glucose metabolism, although ketone metabolism is not affected. Therefore, the shift from glucose metabolism to ketone metabolism may be a reasonable pathway for neuronal protection. To promote ketone metabolism, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil and a ketogenic diet could be introduced as an alternative source of energy in the brain of AD patients.\n\nKeywords: Alzheimer's disease; amyloid-beta; type 2 diabetes mellitus; insulin resistance; glucose metabolism; ketone metabolism; ketogenic diet; coconut oil; MCT oil",

        "content": "Today, as many as 50 million people worldwide have dementia, the most common form of which is Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD typically manifests as a progressive loss of memory and cognitive function. Cerebral plaques laden with amyloidβ (A β ) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of tau are important hallmarks of AD [1]. A β accumulation is associated with functional and structural brain alterations, consistent with the patterns of abnormalities seen in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well as AD [2]. The amyloid cascade hypothesis suggests that the deposition of A β triggers neuronal dysfunction, vascular damage, and cell death in the brain [3]. Moreover, A β has been reported to directly impair the glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) pathway [1]. In fact, patients with AD show insulin resistance in the brain [4].\n\nRegarding glucose metabolism disorders, diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common public health problems worldwide. The global prevalence of DM in 2019 was estimated to be 9.3% (463 million people), rising to 10.2% (578 million) by 2030 and 10.9% (700 million) by 2045 [5]. The pathogenesis of type 2 DM (T2DM) is primarily initiated by the inadequate function of pancreatic β -cells in response to glycemic overload, which then causes insulin resistance. Thus, patients with T2DM are relatively insulin deficient.\n\nHerein, it can be said that insulin plays an important role in the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiological hypometabolism of glucose in both AD and T2DM. In fact, T2DM was reported to predispose patients to neurodegenerative disorders, including AD [6]. A meta-analysis reported that the odds ratio for conversion from MCI into AD in patients\n\n/gid00001\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCitation: Takeishi, J.; Tatewaki, Y.; Nakase, T.; Takano, Y.; Tomita, N.; Yamamoto, S.; Mutoh, T.; Taki, Y.

Therefore, in this review, we will focus on the shared pathogeneses in AD and T2DM and the decreased use of glucose in the brain. To this end, for a potential of nonpharmacological molecular biology treatment, we will discuss the ketogenic diet (KD), a high-fat and low-carbohydrate diet in which coconut oil and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil are often used as an alternative source of energy against glucose.",

        "title": "2. Risk of AD",
        "content": "The risk of developing AD is divided into two categories: inherited and modifiable. Genetic involvement is an inherited risk factor for AD. Mutations in the genes of amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and PSEN2 are associated with the early onset of familial AD [8]. APP is normally cleaved by α -secretase, but its mutation affects α -cleavage and increases β - and γ -cleavage, resulting in the accumulation of A β . PSEN1 and PSEN2 are components of γ -secretase, and their mutation influences the increased activity of γ -secretase, resulting in the accumulation of A β . Additionally, a polymorphism in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene can be a major risk factor for sporadic AD. APOE has three isoforms: E2, E3, and E4. Thus, APOE4 is thought to increase the A β burden by interfering with A β clearance [9].\n\nNumerous modifiable factors have been investigated as risk factors for AD [10]. Among them, lifestyle habits, such as decreased physical activity, midlife obesity, alcohol intake, and smoking, are important since they can be controlled in our daily life [11]. Moreover, such lifestyle habits are also risks of cerebrovascular disease [12], hypertension [13], dyslipidemia, and DM [14]. In fact, these diseases are involved in AD pathogenesis. Therefore, it can be said that we can partly control the onset of AD by changing such modifiable risk factors.",

        "title": "3. AD and DM: Mechanisms of Cognitive Decline Associated with Insulin Resistance",
        "content": "Insulin is secreted from the pancreas, and regulates glucose metabolism by means of activation of the insulin receptor (IR). In patients with T2DM, because of the inappropriate secretion of insulin triggered by an abnormal glucose overload, insulin resistance will primarily be observed. Then, the persistent stress of insulin secretion may result in the dysfunction of pancreatic β -cells. Meanwhile, insulin has long been implicated in cognitive performance [15,16]. First, IRs are located in the central nervous system synapses [17,18], and insulin, which comes from the general circulation, can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [19] via a saturable transporter [20]. Then, as shown in Figure 1, insulin binds to the IR at the synapse, and autophosphorylation of the IR occurs. An activated IR phosphorylates the insulin receptor substrate (IRS). This results in the cascade of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1) activation, and protein kinase B (Akt) activation. Activated Akt can activate glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK3 β ), mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), and forkhead box O (FOXO1). Then, these downstream cascades influence the activity of AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit-1 (GluA1) and NMDA-type glutamate receptor subunit 2 B (GluN2B) [21-23]. Since both GluA1 and GluN2B play a critical role in synaptic plasticity, insulin can be associated with memory and learning in the hippocampus [24]. Moreover, activated Akt promotes the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading to the activation of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator 1 α (PGC1 α ). This pathway plays an important role in mitochondrial metabolism, a major source of ATP [25-27].\n\nSimilar to the insulin pathology in T2DM patients, it has been reported that impaired insulin action is observed in the brain of AD patients [4]. Three pathologies have been suspected: reduced transport of insulin into the brain [28,29], reduced insulin levels in the brain [30], and poorly functioning IRs in the brain [31,32]. It was reported that, in the brains of aged mice, Akt was optimally phosphorylated by the infusion of insulin, not into peripheral blood, but into the cerebral ventricle.

A reduced cerebrospinal fluid/serum in-\n\ninsulin ratio was observed in an elderly human brain. This study concluded that insulin uptake at the BBB may be affected in the aged brain [28]. Another study reported that both brain insulin and c-peptide levels decreased alongside aging, and were lower in an AD brain than in an age-matched control. Moreover, decreased IR density was milder in an ADbrain than in an age-matched control, suggesting that IR activity may be decreased in ADpathology [33]. In the hippocampal formation of an AD brain, the increased phosphorylation of the IRS was reported to be related to the deactivation of the IR-IRS-PI3K-Akt pathway. This observation was independent from the DM and APOE phenotype, and presented a negative correlation with A β accumulation, concluding that impaired function of IRs may be caused by A β -related IRS phosphorylation [31]. sulin ratio was observed in an elderly human brain.

Moreover, the uptake rate constants of glucose (KGlu) in AD were ~15% lower in the same regions and subcortical regions than in healthy older adults [37]. Meanwhile, neither the regional nor whole-brain CMR of acetoacetate (CMRAcAc) and uptake rate constants\n\nof AcAc were significantly different between the healthy older adult controls and MCI or ADgroups [37,38]. Additionally, it has been reported that CMRAcAc did not significantly differ between healthy young adults and healthy older adults [39]. These reports suggest that glucose metabolism easily declines when people get older or experience cognitive decline, while ketone metabolism is almost unchanged.\n\nInterventional studies focusing on a KD have reported that a 14-day high-fat KD using older rats showed a 28% and 44% increase in whole-brain CMRAcAc and CMRGlc, respectively [40,41]. On the other hand, a trial on human adults with a KD showed that the CMRAcAc was significantly increased ( p = 0.005) but that the CMRGlu was significantly decreased by 20% ( p = 0.014) [42]. Whether a KD increases or decreases glucose uptake in the brain after intervention remains an issue to be decided.",

        "content": "As mentioned above, in contrast to the decline in cerebral glucose metabolism, since cerebral ketone metabolism is well preserved, a KD could be a potential intervention against decreased brain activity.\n\nOrdinary Americans consume 50-65% of their energy from carbohydrates, whereas a KDis a very high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that restricts carbohydrates to ≤ 10% of the energy consumed. It is considered to be a difficult diet to maintain. This macronutrient profile promotes a systemic shift from glucose metabolism toward the conversion of fatty acids into ketone bodies as a substrate for energy. Some food products that are known to contain rich ketone body precursors are coconut oil and MCT oil. The coconut tree bears a large number of fruits in regions of India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Coconut oil is derived from the pulp of coconut fruit and is used for cooking oil. Coconut oil is a source of polyphenols and is rich in dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals [43]. Coconut oil is comprised of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) (&gt;90%) and small amounts of mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids. In a randomized trial, coconut oil was shown to significantly increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels compared to butter and olive oil [44,45]. The lipid profile of coconut oil was demonstrated to be better than that of animal oils and other plant oils [46,47]. Additionally, coconut oil has been reported to have numerous medicinal benefits, including antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antiparasitic, antidermatophytic, antioxidant, hypoglycemic, hepatoprotective, and immunostimulant effects [48]. Nonetheless, regular coconut oil intake should be cautiously considered because of its high levels of SFAs. Diets rich in SFAs are associated with coronary heart disease [49,50]. More research is needed to balance the risk of coconut oil in cardiovascular diseases against its other benefits.\n\nOn the other hand, MCT oil consists only of MCTs, which are lipid molecules that are more readily absorbed and oxidized than most lipids. Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) are saturated fatty acids with carbon chain lengths of C6, C8, C10, or C12. MCTs are comprised primarily of octanoic acid (C8), decanoic acid (C10), and small proportions of caprice acid (C6) and lauric acid (C12). In reality, 62-70% of SFAs become MCTs [51]. Therefore, it can be said that MCT oil is more effective than coconut oil, since coconut oil contains various kinds of SFAs. Dietary MCTs are partially hydrolyzed by lingual lipase in the stomach and then hydrolyzed rapidly and efficiently by pancreatic lipase within the intestinal lumen. A minor proportion of MCFAs bypass the liver and are distributed to peripheral tissues via general circulation [52-54]. Subsequently, MCFAs are directly absorbed through the gut via the portal vein to the liver, rather than through the thoracic duct lymph system, which is the conventional route for the absorption of triglycerides containing light-chain fatty acids [52]. Within the liver mitochondria, MCFAs are rapidly metabolized through β -oxidation and finally become ketone bodies, such as β -hydroxybutyrate ( β HB), AcAc, and acetone. Thus, the unique characteristics of MCFAs, which are easily absorbed and metabolized, have led to interest in their use in the management of several gastrointestinal disorders, where MCTs have been primarily used to reduce fat malabsorption and serve as a source of calories to optimize their nutritional status.",

        "content": "The KD was originally developed as a treatment for epilepsy in the 1920s, as fasting was known to reduce the frequency of seizures [55]. Numerous studies have revealed the efficacy of a KD for epilepsy treatment [56-58].\n\nOn the other hand, a KD has been attractive as non-pharmacological treatment for T2DM. It was reported that, after 56 weeks of a KD, body weight, BMI, blood glucose level, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), triglycerides, and urea levels significantly decreased, whereas the level of HDL cholesterol significantly increased. Interestingly, these changes were more significant in subjects who had a high blood glucose level than in those with a normal blood glucose level [59]. Moreover, a KD was reported to show beneficial effects on weight loss in overweight and obese participants when compared to a conventional low-calorie diet [60].\n\nBy extension, the shift from glucose metabolism to ketone metabolism in patients with ADmay be reasonable for neuronal protection. Patients with mild-to-moderate AD were assessed by neurocognitive tests after taking 50 g of a ketogenic formula containing 20 g of MCTs or an isocaloric placebo formula without MCTs [61]. The patients then took the ketogenic formula daily for up to 12 weeks and underwent neurocognitive tests monthly. At 8 weeks after the start of the trial, the patients showed a significant improvement in their immediate and delayed logical memory tests compared to their baseline scores; at 12 weeks, they showed significant improvements in the digit-symbol coding test and immediate logical memory test compared to the baseline. Hence, chronic consumption of the ketogenic formula has been suggested to have positive effects on verbal memory and processing speed in patients with AD. It was reported that AD patients with a KD who achieved sustained physiological ketosis showed an increase in mean within-individual AD cooperative study-activities of daily living (ADCS-ADL) (+3.13 ± 5.01 points, p = 0.0067) and quality of life in AD (+3.37 ± 6.86 points, p = 0.023) scores compared to those with a usual diet [62]. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials with 422 participants showed, compared with a placebo, a trend toward cognitive improvement on the AD assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) (MD = -0.539; 95% CI, -1.239-0.161, I2 = 0%), and significantly improved cognition when combining ADAS-Cog with the MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) (SMD = -0.289; 95% CI, -0.551--0.027, I2 = 0%) [63]. Moreover, in frail elderly patients, MCT supplementation increased the MMSE score by 3.5 points at the 3-month intervention from baseline ( p &lt; 0.001), whereas long-chain triglyceride supplementation decreased the MMSE score by -0.7 points [64].",

        "content": "Studies involving treating epilepsy patients with a KD have suggested that a KD introduces ketone bodies which influence the TCA cycle, membrane potential hyperpolarization, γ -aminobutyric acid synthesis, and decreasing glutamate release [65]. A KD may have many different effects as an anti-epileptic treatment. The possible benefit of a KD on T2DM patients is mainly because of the reduction in blood glucose level as well as improving the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) [66]. In patients with AD, several mechanisms can be expected for the improvement of cognitive function regarding the introduction of a KD.\n\nIn brief, within the liver mitochondria, MCFAs are rapidly metabolized to ketone bodies, whereas the liver does not have enzymes that produce Ac-CoA from ketones [67,68], which means that the liver cannot produce energy from ketones via the TCA cycle. Ketones and minor MCFAs escape from liver metabolism and are transported to the whole body, especially the brain, where the enzymes produce Ac-CoA. Arriving at the brain, ketones and MCFAs can cross the BBB [69,70]; therefore, they enter the TCA cycle and generate energy. Ac-CoA is also generated from pyruvate, a glycolytic product, by pyruvate dehydrogenase. This can then enter the TCA cycle to generate more energy [71]. However, in AD patients, they cannot utilize sufficient glucose; thus, Ac-CoA, which comes through the glycolytic pathway, will lower its concentration in the mitochondria, resulting in a decrease in energy\n\nproduction. This mechanism may also be applied to patients with DM who cannot take glucose from the bloodstream. Ketone can bypass the blockade of glycolysis induced by insulin deficiency, thereby providing an alternative source of mitochondrial Ac-CoA [72]. AcAc and β HB, which are produced in the liver and supplied to the brain, may serve as alternative sources of energy in neurons. Through this pathway, a KD contributes to maintaining neuronal activity, leading to the improvement of cognitive performance.",

MB is controlled by nuclear sirtuins (SIRT1) [25,73], and a KD has been reported to improve energy metabolism and MB in the hippocampus of rats [74]. A KD may improve MBin neuronal cells, probably via PGC1α and/or sirtuins [75]. It has been reported that when an HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line was incubated with decanoic acid, a main component of MCT oil, or β HB, a metabolite of MCFAs, a significant elevation of SIRT1 enzyme activity and an overall upregulation of MRC were observed [76]. In addition, decanoic acid was reported to function as a direct PPAR γ ligand [77]. PPAR γ is a subfamily of nuclear receptors that plays a significant role in glucose and lipid metabolism. In fact, it is a therapeutic target of the DM drug, thiazolidinedione [78]. Furthermore, PPAR γ agonists were reported to promote the biogenesis of functional mitochondria [79]. One study attempted treatment with decanoic acid in individuals diagnosed with mitochondrial disease. This treatment increased citrate synthase activity, a marker of cellular mitochondrial content, in 50% of fibroblasts obtained from patients with Leigh syndrome [80]. Another study also showed that decanoic acid, but not octanoic acid, caused a marked increase in citrate synthase, along with complex I activity and catalase activity, in neuronal cell lines. They also observed an increase in mitochondrial number, as indicated by electron microscopy [81]. The other study reported that the HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line, incubated with decanoic acid, showed prominent increases in maximal activities of complexes I + III and complex IV of the MCR as well as ratios of their activities to that of citrate synthase [76].",

However, many recent studies have changed this view of lactate, shifting from a glycolytic waste product to an important energy fuel with an interesting molecular pathway [84,85]. It can be said that lactate produced by astrocytic glycolysis could be a supplementary fuel for neighboring neurons [86-88]. This is referred to as the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) hypothesis. As a consequence of high glycolytic activity, astrocytes release lactate into the extracellular space, which can then be taken up by neighboring neurons and serve as an oxidative fuel for their mitochondria [89,90]. One study showed that, using single-cell imaging, decanoic acid produced lactate by inducing glycolysis [89]. The researchers implied that decanoic acid works for astrocyte metabolism and supplies lactate to neighboring neurons by the ANLS. In the brain of patients with AD, this hypothesis remains controversial [84,91,92]. Since MCT oil contains decanoic acid, the effect of MCT oil through the ANLS may be an interesting target for the future.",

MCT oil, a critical component of a KD, is an interesting material for competing AD pathology, because it can be an effective source of ketone as well as maintaining mitochondrial function. Exploring the metabolic impairment in the brain of patients with AD will currently be important from the viewpoint of non-pharmaceutical therapy of AD.\n\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.T. and Y.T.

        "content": "Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is an innate immune receptor predominantly expressed by microglia in the brain. Recent studies have established TREM2 as a central immune signaling hub in neurodegeneration, where it triggers immune responses upon sensing pathological development and tissue damages. TREM2 binds diverse ligands and activates downstream pathways that regulate microglial phagocytosis, inflammatory responses, and metabolic reprogramming. Interestingly, TREM2 exists both in its membrane-bound form and as a soluble variant (sTREM2), that latter is generated through proteolytic shedding or alternative splicing and can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma. Emerging clinical and preclinical evidence underscores the potential of TREM2 and sTREM2 as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the molecular functions, regulatory mechanisms, and pathological implications of TREM2 and sTREM2 in AD. Furthermore, we explore their potential roles in diagnostics and therapeutics while suggesting key research directions for advancing TREM2/sTREM2-based strategies in combating AD.\n\nKeywords TREM2, sTREM2, Microglia, Metabolism, Amyloid, Tau, Neurodegeneration, Alzheimer's disease",

        "content": "Alzheimer's  disease  (AD)  is  a  devastating  neurodegenerative disorder marked by progressive cognitive decline and  key  neuropathological  features,  such  as  amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and chronic neuroinflammation [1-3]. While significant strides have been made  in  understanding  these  pathological  markers,  the role of microglia-the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS)-has gained increasing attention over the past decade. Microglia play a crucial role in maintaining  brain  homeostasis;  however,  they  become dysregulated in AD, contributing to disease progression through  maladaptive  neuroinflammatory  responses  and impaired clearance of neurotoxic materials [4, 5]. A key player  in  microglial  functions  is  the  triggering  receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), a transmembrane  receptor  that  has  been  strongly  associated  with the risk for AD [6, 7].

Binding  of  ligands-including lipids,  lipoproteins,  apolipoproteins,  or  Aβ-to  TREM2 triggers intracellular signaling cascades  that regulate microglial responses to AD pathology [10, 12]. Notably, genetic  variants  of  TREM2,  especially  the  R47H  mutation,  are  strongly  associated  with  increased  AD  risk  [6, 7]. These mutations impair TREM2 functions, leading to reduced microglial activation, dysregulated inflammatory responses, impaired metabolic functions, and inadequate clearance of Aβ. Collectively, these factors exacerbate AD pathology, emphasizing TREM2's central role in both AD susceptibility and progression, and reinforcing its potential as a therapeutic target to enhance microglial protective function and combat disease mechanisms [13].\n\nBeyond  its  role  as  a  cell-surface  receptor,  TREM2 undergoes proteolytic cleavage or alternative splicing,  resulting  in  the  release  of  its  soluble  ectodomain (sTREM2)  into  the  extracellular  space,  where  it  can  be detected  in  cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF)  and  plasma  [1417].  As  both  a  biomarker  and  a  potential  modulator  in AD,  sTREM2  has  been  associated  with  microglial  activation and disease progression, as evidenced by findings from  human  studies  and  AD  mouse  models.  Elevated CSF sTREM2 levels correlate  with  early  AD  stages  and neuroinflammatory responses, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker [18, 19]. Furthermore, preclinical and clinical studies indicate that sTREM2 may exert neuroprotective effects by mitigating Aβ and tau pathologies, potentially slowing cognitive decline and disease progression [20-23].\n\nDespite these advances, many questions remain unanswered  regarding  the  precise  mechanisms  by  which TREM2 and sTREM2 influence microglial functions and AD pathogenesis.  Understanding  the  interplay  between genetic variations, TREM2  signaling,  and  sTREM2mediated effects could provide valuable insights into AD pathogenesis and guide the development of targeted therapies. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge on TREM2 and sTREM2 in AD, focusing on their molecular  functions,  pathological  implications,  and  therapeutic potential. By consolidating recent findings, we seek to highlight critical gaps in our understanding and propose future  directions  for  advancing  TREM2/sTREM2-based strategies in AD diagnostics and therapeutics.",

        "content": "Genetic  variations  in  TREM2  have  been  implicated  in several neurodegenerative disorders, including AD, frontotemporal  dementia  (FTD),  and  Nasu-Hakola  disease (NHD), with over 70 variants identified to date [9]. Homozygous  TREM2  mutations,  including  early  stop codons (E14X, Q33X, W44X, W78X) [24-27] and missense mutations in the immunoglobulin-like ectodomain (Y38C, W50C, T66M, V126G) [24, 28, 29], are primarily linked to NHD, a rare disorder characterized by earlyonset dementia, demyelination, and bone cysts. Notably, some  patients  carrying  specific  homozygous  TREM2 mutations,  such  as  Q33X,  Y38C,  and  T66M,  exhibit  an FTD-like  syndrome  with  behavioral  changes,  cognitive decline,  and  motor  impairments  [24].  Unlike  classical NHD, these FTD patients do not develop bone cysts or other  obvious  skeletal  abnormalities.  This  phenotypic variability  suggests  that  the  clinical  manifestations  of these mutations may also be influenced by genetic background or environmental factors.\n\nThe  most  well-established  TREM2  variant  associated with AD is the R47H substitution (rs75932628) [6, 7, 30]. Early studies in European and North American cohorts identified  a  strong  association  between  heterozygous R47H carriers and AD, reporting odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 2.83 to 4.59-comparable to the risk conferred by  the  APOE  ε4  allele  [6,  7].  These  findings  have  been consistently  validated  by  subsequent  meta-analyses  and replication  studies  [31-36].  Notably,  individuals  homozygous for the R47H variant face an even greater risk of developing AD compared to heterozygous carriers [30]. Interestingly,  cognitive  decline  has  been  observed  in R47H carriers between the ages of 80 and 100, even in the absence of an AD diagnosis [7]. However, the association between R47H and AD appears weaker in non-European populations,  including  African-American  [37],  Chinese [38-41],  and  Japanese  [42]  cohorts.  Furthermore,  while R47H  has  been  linked  to  an  increased  risk  of  FTD  in North  American  populations  [43],  no  such  association has been observed in European cohorts [36], highlighting the geographic and genetic heterogeneity in its effects.\n\nOther  AD-associated  TREM2  variants  also  exhibit population-specific associations. For instance, the R62H variant  (rs143332484)  serves  as  a  significant  AD  risk modifier in Caucasian populations [34, 35], but it is not associated with AD risk in African-Americans, likely due to its low frequency in this population [37]. The H157Y variant  (rs2234255),  identified  in  Han  Chinese  populations,  is  linked  to  late-onset  AD  [44],  with  subsequent studies  supporting  the  association  in  the  Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ORs: 4.7) [45], while a large Caucasian case-control study found no significant correlation [35]. These findings highlight the intricate role of\n\nTREM2  genetic  variations  in  neurodegeneration,  with their effects influenced by mutation type, genetic ancestry,  and  disease  stage  or  pathological  environment.  The three-dimensional  structure  of  TREM2,  elucidated  by X-ray  crystallography,  offers  further  insights  into  the functional consequences of these genetic variants. NHDassociated mutations are predominantly localized to buried  regions  of  the  protein,  potentially  destabilizing  its structure [46]. In contrast, AD-associated variants reside on  the  protein's  surface,  impairing  ligand  binding  and receptor activation. For example, the R47H substitution reduces TREM2's affinity for key ligands, including phospholipids and Aβ, leading to diminished downstream signaling [47-49].\n\nTREM2 signaling is mediated by the adaptor proteins DAP12  and  DAP10,  as  TREM2  itself  lacks  an  intrinsic signaling domain [50, 51] (Fig. 1). Ligand binding to the extracellular domain of TREM2 initiates downstream signaling cascade. TREM2 ligands include Aβ and a diverse array of lipids, such as phospholipids and sphingolipids. Additionally, TREM2  interacts with apolipoproteins, including apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and apolipoprotein J (ApoJ),  as  well  as  lipoproteins  like  low-density  lipoprotein  (LDL)  and  high-density  lipoprotein  (HDL)  [47-49, 52-55]. Upon ligand binding to TREM2, the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in DAP12 is phosphorylated by Src family kinases, creating a docking  site  for  spleen  tyrosine  kinase  (SYK).  SYK  is  then recruited and activated, initiating downstream signaling [10]. Concurrently, DAP10, through its cytosolic YXNM motif,  directly  recruits  the  PI3K  subunit  to  activate  the PI3K  pathway,  thereby  amplifying  the  cellular  response to TREM2 activation [10]. SYK and PI3K activation subsequently  trigger  multiple  downstream  pathways  that regulate diverse cellular processes (Fig. 1). Key signaling cascades  downstream  of  SYK  include  phospholipase  C gamma 2 (PLCγ2), Rac1/Cdc42, ERK and PI3K [51, 56, 57]. These pathways regulate distinct yet interconnected microglial  functions.  Specifically,  PLCγ2  activation  is critical for microglial phagocytosis and lipid metabolism [56].  Meanwhile,  Rac1/Cdc42-GTPase  signaling  plays a  key  role  in  cytoskeletal  remodeling  and  cell  migration [57]. Additionally, the ERK pathway is essential for microglial survival, proliferation, and inflammatory responses  [51].  In  parallel,  the  PI3K/Akt  pathway,  activated by both DAP10 and SYK, governs essential cellular processes such as survival, proliferation, and glucose metabolism  [11,  58-60].  Collectively,  these  pathways coordinate  microglial  responses  to  environmental  cues, highlighting  the  central  role  of  TREM2  signaling  in microglial functions.\n\nBeyond its role in TREM2 signaling, DAP12 itself has emerged  as  a  key  regulator  of  microglial  functions  in AD  [61].  Genetic  studies  have  identified  heterozygous loss-of-function  variants  in  TYROBP,  the  gene  encoding  DAP12, which are strongly associated with AD risk [30]. This underscores the importance of intact DAP12dependent  pathways  in  disease  modulation.  While  the precise  functional  consequences  of  altered  DAP12  signaling remain an area of active investigation, it is evident that  defects  in  this  adaptor  protein  profoundly  impact microglial responses to pathological insults.\n\nThe TREM2-DAP12 signaling pathway is dynamically regulated.   As demonstrated in osteoclasts, phosphorylation  of  DAP12  following  receptor  cross-linking  recruits SH2-containing  inositol  polyphosphate  phosphatase  1 (SHIP1),  which  antagonizes  SYK  activation  and  dampens  downstream  signaling  [51].    While  this  mechanism has not been directly validated in microglia, the conservation  of  DAP12-SHIP1-SYK  signaling  modules  across myeloid lineages suggests potential functional relevance. This recruitment serves as a negative regulatory mechanism, fine-tuning TREM2-dependent activation.   A ligand avidity-dependent  model  extrapolated  from  these  findings proposes that low-avidity ligands preferentially drive SHIP1 recruitment to suppress signaling, whereas highavidity  ligands  that  induce  TREM2  cross-linking  promote robust SYK-dependent activation.   This hypothesis could explain why heterozygous TREM2 variants impairing ligand binding mimic low-affinity ligand effects, shifting the balance toward inhibition.\n\nIn conclusion, TREM2 orchestrates multiple microglial functions,  including  cell  survival,  proliferation,  migration,  phagocytosis  and  metabolism,  through  a  complex intracellular signaling network. Understanding how genetic  variants  affect  TREM2  structure  and  function is  critical  for  elucidating  the  mechanisms  underlying neurodegenerative  diseases  and  may  provide  valuable insights for potential therapeutic strategies.",

Large-scale  proteomic  analyses  of  brain  and CSF samples from AD patients reveal significant alterations  in  glucose  metabolism,  which  correlate  with  both AD pathology and cognitive decline [63]. Key glycolytic genes,  such  as  pyruvate  kinase  muscle  isoform  (PKM) and lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB), are upregulated in AD, highlighting the central role of glucose metabolism in  disease  progression  [64].  Among  various  cell  types, microglia play a particularly important role in AD-related metabolic changes [63].\n\nAcute  exposure  to  Aβ  induces  metabolic  reprogramming  in microglia, shifting  energy  production  from oxidative  phosphorylation  to  glycolysis  [65].

The membrane-bound TREM2 receptor interacts with various ligands, including lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins and amyloid-β. Ligand binding to TREM2 triggers the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the ITAM motif of the DAP12 cytoplasmic domain by SRC family kinases. The phosphorylated ITAM recruit the protein tyrosine kinase SYK to activate downstream signaling pathways. Additionally, TREM2 can associate with DAP10 homodimer, which contains YXNM motifs. These motifs directly recruit PI3K, activating further signaling pathways. SYK activation drives key pathways, including PLCγ2, Rac1/Cdc42, ERK, and PI3K. PLCγ2 activation is critical for microglial phagocytosis and lipid metabolism. Meanwhile, Rac1/Cdc42-GTPase signaling plays a key role in cytoskeletal remodeling and cell migration.

Interestingly,  lactate  production  further  amplifies  glycolysis  through  histone  lactylation,  which  upregulates glycolytic  gene  expression  in  a  positive  feedback  loop [64].  Disrupting  this  feedback  loop  has  been  shown  to restore  microglial  protective  functions,  although  how\n\nAβ  induces  metabolic  pathway  alterations  in  microglia remains incompletely understood.\n\nThe metabolic fitness of microglia is markedly impaired in TREM2 knockout (KO) models [58]. TREM2, through its adaptors DAP12 and DAP10, activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which plays  a  crucial  role  in  regulating  metabolic  pathways and  protein  synthesis  [11,  58].  Loss  of  TREM2  impairs\n\nmTOR  activation,  leading  to  reduced  ATP  production and biosynthesis. In vivo FDG-PET imaging of TREM2 KO and TREM2 T66M knock-in mice shows a significant reduction  in  cerebral  glucose  metabolism  [67,  68].  This decrease may correlate with impaired glucose uptake by microglia. Supporting this, ex vivo measurements of isolated  microglia  from  TREM2  KO  animals  reveal  lower FDG uptake [68].\n\nGiven  the  pivotal  role  of  microglial  metabolism  in AD, targeting this process represents a promising therapeutic strategy. Agents such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and cyclocreatine,  which  enhance  ATP  production,  have been shown to restore microglial functions and mitigate AD pathology [58, 65]. Notably, TREM2-activating antibodies  boost  microglial  energy  metabolism  by  promoting mitochondrial fatty acid and glucose oxidation [69]. Moreover,  translocator  protein  (TSPO)-PET  and  FDGPET imaging have demonstrated that TREM2 activation enhances  microglial  activity  and  glucose  metabolism in  amyloid  mouse  models.  Thus,  targeting  TREM2  and microglial  metabolism  may  complement  existing  AD therapies,  which  primarily  focus  on  amyloid  clearance and synaptic dysfunction, providing a more comprehensive approach to disease intervention.",

        "content": "Lipid  metabolism  is  crucial  for  maintaining  microglial functions  and  CNS  homeostasis,  influencing  cellular membrane  integrity,  energy  storage,  and  inflammatory responses. Emerging evidence identifies TREM2 as a key regulator of lipid metabolism in the brain. TREM2 binds a  diverse  range  of  lipids,  including  anionic  and  zwitterionic  species  such  as  sphingomyelin,  phosphatidic  acid, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine  (PtdSer) and  sulfatide [49, 53, 70]. Among these, PtdSer is the most abundant negatively  charged  phospholipid  in  the  inner  leaflet  of the plasma membrane in eukaryotic cells [71]. In neurodegenerative conditions, PtdSer externalization on damaged or apoptotic neurons serves as an 'eat-me' signal, triggering  TREM2-dependent  microglial  synaptic  pruning and cell clearance [72]. Super-resolution microscopy and in vivo imaging studies have demonstrated that Aβ oligomer-induced  hyperactive  synapses  expose  PtdSer, marking them for TREM2-mediated engulfment, which helps  mitigate  neuronal  hyperactivity  in  AD  models. Additionally,  individuals  carrying  TREM2  loss-of-function  variants  exhibit  an  accumulation  of  apoptotic-like synapses  [72],  underscoring  TREM2's  essential  role  in synaptic homeostasis during early AD pathology. Beyond synaptic pruning, TREM2 facilitates the recognition and clearance  of  damaged  cells.  Notably,  over-expression  of TREM2 in non-phagocytic cells, such as Chinese hamster  ovary  (CHO)  and  HEK293  cells,  enables  them  to engulf  apoptotic  neurons,  highlighting  TREM2's  function in lipid sensing and phagocytosis [16, 73]. This broad lipid-binding  capability  underscores  TREM2's  critical role in modulating microglial responses to neurodegenerative insults and preserving neuronal health.\n\nTREM2  also  regulates  microglial  responses  during demyelination,  as  observed  in  aging,  cuprizone  treatment,  and  lysolecithin  injection  models.  In  wild-type (WT) animals, microglial clusters, termed nodules, form in  the  white  matter  and  increase  with  age  [74].  These nodules are involved in clearing degenerated myelin, and their  formation  depends  on  TREM2,  as  fewer  clusters are  observed in TREM2 KO or loss-of-function mutant animals  [67,  74].  In  aged  TREM2-deficient  animals, myelin debris accumulation correlates with reduced myelin  integrity,  increased  axonal  damage,  and  fewer mature  oligodendrocytes  in  the  striatum,  underscoring TREM2's protective role in aging [75]. In the cuprizone model  of  toxic  demyelination,  TREM2's  involvement  in microglial  activation  is  further  confirmed.  After  cuprizone  treatment,  microglia  exhibit  an  amoeboid-activated  morphology  [76].  However,  in  TREM2  KO  mice, microglia  maintain  a  more  ramified  morphology  with less  microgliosis.  At  the  transcriptomic  level,  microglia from  TREM2-deficient  animals  fail  to  upregulate  genes related to activation, phagocytosis, and lipid metabolism, impairing  lysosomal  and  phagosomal  function,  disrupting  oxidative  phosphorylation,  and  altering  cholesterol metabolism  [76-78].  This  failure  to  clear  myelin  debris leads  to  impaired  axonal  transport,  axonal  dystrophies, and  worsened  locomotor  deficits  in  TREM2  KO  mice compared  to  WT  controls.  Similarly,  in  the  lysolecithin-induced demyelination model, TREM2-deficient mice show a marked accumulation of myelin debris and impaired lesion recovery. This is evidenced by a significant reduction in the number of remyelinated axons, as observed  via  transmission  electron  microscopy  3  to  8 weeks post-injection [79, 80]. These findings suggest that TREM2 deficiency impairs myelin clearance, likely due to defects in phagocytosis, reduced lysosomal degradation, or a combination of both.\n\nAnother key aspect of TREM2 function is its regulation of  lipid  droplet  formation.  In  the  lysolecithin  injection model, TREM2 deficiency led to a significant reduction in  lipid  droplets  within  microglia  and  macrophages  at lesion  sites,  as  indicated  by  immunostaining  for  perilipin 2, a key structural component of lipid droplets [79]. The impaired biogenesis of lipid droplets and cholesterol esterification  in  TREM2-deficient  microglia  was  associated  with  elevated  endoplasmic  reticulum  stress,  ultimately hindering the remyelination process. In contrast, in  the  cuprizone  model,  TREM2  deficiency  resulted  in excessive  accumulation  of  cholesteryl  ester  in  microglia  [77].  This  accumulation  is  associated  with  elevated\n\nplasma neurofilament light chain (Nf-L) levels, a marker of  axonal  damage,  indicating  a  link  between  TREM2 deficiency, lipid dysregulation, and neuronal injury. Further  supporting  this  connection,  human  induced  pluripotent stem  cell (iPSC)-derived  microglia-like  cells (iMGLs)  with  TREM2  KO  exhibit  lipid  accumulation following  myelin  treatment,  as  demonstrated  by  Nile Red  staining  [56].  This  accumulation  is  dependent  on downstream PLCγ2 activity. These findings highlight the critical  role  of  TREM2  in  lipid  metabolism.  The  variations in lipid droplet accumulation observed across different models may stem from differences in experimental design-such  as  the  method  of  demyelination  (local demyelination  induced  by  lysolecithin  injection  versus global  demyelination  triggered  by  cuprizone  feeding), the time points analyzed (e.g., a 0.2% cuprizone diet for 5  or  12  weeks  during  demyelination  versus  21  and  62 days post-lysolecithin injection during remyelination versus iMGLs exposed to myelin debris for 48 h), or the lipid visualization techniques employed (perilipin 2 staining  versus  Nile  Red  staining).  Despite  these  discrepancies,  these  studies  collectively  reinforce  the  protective role of TREM2 in remyelination and neuronal function. However,  the  precise  molecular  mechanisms  by  which TREM2 regulates lipid metabolism and the downstream events leading to altered lipid levels in its absence are not fully  understood.  Addressing  these  gaps  through  future research will be essential for unraveling the complex relationship  between  TREM2  signaling,  lipid  metabolism, and neurodegeneration.",

        "content": "Aβ  accumulation  is  one  of  the  hallmark  pathological  features  of  AD,  contributing  to  neuroinflammation, synaptic  dysfunction,  and  neuronal  loss.  TREM2  plays a  central  role  in  mediating  microglial  responses  to  Aβ, thus serving as a key player in the brain's defense against Aβ  pathology.  TREM2  directly  binds  to  Aβ,  exhibiting particularly  high  affinity  for  Aβ42  oligomers  due  to  the irreversibility  of  this  interaction,  whereas  its  binding  to Aβ42 and Aβ40 monomers is much weaker and reversible [47, 48, 81]. The binding of Aβ to TREM2 triggers a cascade  of  microglial  responses  that  involve  activation, clustering, and enhanced clearance of these toxic aggregates  in  a  TREM2-dependent  manner  [47,  48,  81,  82] (Fig.  2).  Moreover,  TREM2  facilitates  the  clustering  of microglia around Aβ plaques, an essential component of the  microglial  response  to  amyloid  deposition  [82-84]. This clustering helps form a protective barrier around Aβ plaques, sequestering the toxic Aβ and modulating local inflammation, thereby limiting its neurotoxic effects [85]. In  the  absence  of  TREM2,  microglial  clustering  is  significantly impaired, leading to more diffuse and neuritic plaque  morphology,  which  exacerbates  the  neurotoxic effects of Aβ [82, 83, 85, 86] (Fig. 2). Studies in TREM2 KO PS2APP mice have shown that the absence of TREM2 leads to an increase in the Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio and the accumulation of soluble, fibrillar Aβ oligomers [87]. Despite a reduction in plaque load at later ages, these alterations are  linked  to  exacerbated  axonal  dystrophy,  dendritic spine  loss,  and  elevated  levels  of  Nf-L  in  the  CSF  [87]. Notably,  the  more  diffuse  plaque  morphology  observed in  TREM2-deficient  mice,  along  with  the  altered  Aβ profile,  highlights  the  critical  neuroprotective  role  of TREM2 in regulating Aβ aggregation and mitigating neuronal damage. These impairments in microglial responses to Aβ are not restricted to animal models; similar observations have been made in human AD patients carrying TREM2 mutations, where reduced microglial clustering around Aβ plaques and increased neuronal dystrophy are evident, reinforcing the vital role of TREM2 in protecting against Aβ toxicity [82, 85].\n\nTREM2 plays  a  pivotal  role  in  modulating  microglial responses  to  Aβ  accumulation  by  orchestrating  their transition  from  a  homeostatic  state  to  a  fully  activated disease-associated  microglia  (DAM)  state  [88-90].  In amyloidosis mouse models, microglial activation follows a two-step process: an initial TREM2-independent phase characterized  by  the  downregulation  of  homeostatic checkpoint genes and the upregulation of neurodegeneration-associated markers, followed by a TREM2-dependent phase essential for the induction of lipid metabolism and phagocytosis-related genes involved in Aβ clearance. In the absence of TREM2, microglia become trapped in an  intermediate  state,  failing  to  fully  activate  the  DAM program or mount an effective response to Aβ accumulation  [88-90].  Studies  in  amyloid  mouse  models  have demonstrated that the loss of functional TREM2 impairs microglial  clustering  around  amyloid  plaques,  reducing microglial phagocytic capacity and leading to inefficient amyloid clearance [49, 83]. Moreover, TREM2 deficiency results in plaques that are less compact and more fibrillar, which correlates with increased dystrophic neurites and neuronal damage, suggesting that TREM2 plays a critical role in buffering Aβ toxicity [83, 91, 92].\n\nThe  protective  role  of  TREM2  is  particularly  evident during  the  early  stages  of  amyloid  deposition.  At  this stage,  TREM2-mediated  signaling  enhances  microglial activation and promotes the clearance of amyloid seeds, thereby  limiting  plaque  formation  [82,  93].  Preclinical  studies  suggest  that  therapeutic  strategies  aimed  at upregulating  TREM2-either  through  increased  gene dosage  or  activating  antibodies-can  enhance  protective  microglial  functions  and  reduce  amyloid  pathology [93-97].  However,  in  later  stages  of  amyloid  pathology, TREM2 upregulation appears to have little or no impact on  plaque  burden,  suggesting  that  its  therapeutic  window may be restricted to early disease progression [93].\n\nFig. 2 Roles of TREM2 in Alzheimer's disease pathology. In the presence of TREM2, amyloid plaque accumulation activates the disease-associated microglia (DAM) program and/or the microglial neurodegenerative (MGnD) phenotype. Microglia cluster around plaques, trimming the peripheral region of amyloid-β fibrils and compacting the plaque structure. Additionally, they form a protective barrier between plaques and surrounding neural tissue, reducing amyloid-β-induced neuritic dystrophy. In contrast, TREM2 deficiency or mutation disrupts the activation of DAM and/or the MGnD phenotype, significantly decreasing the number of plaque-associated microglia. This results in the formation of loosely packed amyloid-β plaques termed filamentous plaque, accompanied by more severe neuritic dystrophy in adjacent areas. Consequently, tau pathology becomes more pronounced, promoting its accumulation and propagation, which ultimately accelerates neuronal loss\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThese findings underscore the necessity for stage-specific therapeutic strategies that take into account the dynamic role  of  TREM2  in  AD  progression.  Overall,  TREM2 is  widely  regarded  as  protective  in  amyloid  pathology by  promoting  microglial  clustering,  phagocytosis,  and plaque  compaction  while  reducing  neurotoxicity.  However, its precise effects may be influenced by factors such as  disease  stage,  genetic  background,  and  environmental  conditions. Future research should aim to refine our understanding  of  these  variables  and  develop  targeted therapeutic  approaches  that  maximize  the  beneficial effects of TREM2 while minimizing potential risks.",

        "content": "Tau  protein  aggregation  and  hyperphosphorylation  are central to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark of AD and other tauopathies. These tau aggregates disrupt neuronal function and connectivity, contributing significantly  to  neurodegeneration.  The  role  of  TREM2 in  tauopathies  is  complex  and  context-dependent,  with its effects often influenced by the presence of Aβ pathology. Studies using mouse models with concurrent Aβ and tau  pathologies,  such  as  the  TauPS2APP  model,  reveal that  TREM2  deficiency  exacerbates  tau  accumulation and propagation, particularly in regions associated with Aβ  plaques  [98].  This  suggests  that  TREM2-dependent\n\nmodulation of microglial responses is crucial for limiting Aβ-induced tau spreading. Specifically, in the context of Aβ plaques, TREM2 deficiency promotes tau seeding in dystrophic  neurites  surrounding  plaques  [99,  100].  This heightened tau seeding correlates with reduced microglial clustering around plaques and elevated levels of neurotoxic Aβ42, reinforcing the idea that TREM2-mediated microglial  responses  help  constrain  tau  propagation  by mitigating  Aβ  toxicity  and  protecting  surrounding  neurons [98-100] (Fig. 2).\n\nIn  contrast,  TREM2's  role  in  tauopathy  models  without  amyloid  pathology,  for  example  the  PS19  and  hTau models,  is less well-defined, with studies  producing mixed results.  In  the  hTau  mouse  model,  characterized by  human  MAPT  overexpression,  TREM2  deficiency accelerates  tau  phosphorylation  and  aggregation  during  early  disease  progression,  although  its  impact  on neurodegeneration and brain atrophy has not been fully assessed  [101].  Conversely,  in  the  PS19  model,  which expresses  the  human  tau  T34  isoform  (one  N-terminal insert and four microtubule binding repeats, 1N4R) with the P301S mutation, complete TREM2 knockout reduces brain  atrophy  associated  with  tau  pathology  [102].  This protective  effect  of  TREM2  loss  is  linked  to  decreased microgliosis and neuroinflammation, suggesting that TREM2-driven microglial activation may exacerbate neurodegeneration  in  certain  tauopathies.  Supporting this, studies have shown that complete TREM2 loss mitigates tau pathology and brain atrophy in the PS19 model [103].  However,  heterozygous  TREM2  deficiency  shows the opposite effect, intensifying tau pathology, brain atrophy, and pro-inflammatory responses in the same model [103].  These  contrasting  findings  highlight  the  complex effects of TREM2 on tau pathology and the need for caution when extrapolating mouse model results to humans. While  TREM2  deletion  causes  fatal  neurodegenerative diseases  in  humans,  such  as  NHD,  TREM2  knockout mice  generally  exhibit  normal  phenotypes  and  do  not develop  similar  conditions.  This  discrepancy  suggests that species-specific differences may influence TREM2's involvement  in  tau  pathology  and  neurodegeneration. Further studies are required to elucidate these differences and clarify TREM2's role in human tauopathies.\n\nThe  TREM2  R47H  variant  offers  additional  insights into TREM2's role in the PS19 tauopathy model, although findings remain inconsistent. In female PS19 mice, where  the  R47H  variant  was  introduced  via  CRISPR/ Cas9-mediated knock-in of human TREM2 R47H cDNA  replacing  endogenous  mTrem2,  spatial  learning and  memory  deficits  were  observed  compared  to  mice expressing the common human TREM2 variant, despite no significant differences in tau pathology [104]. Furthermore, these R47H-expressing mice exhibited exacerbated pro-inflammatory  responses,  suggesting  that  the  R47H\n\nvariant alters microglial functions in a manner that worsens  neuroinflammation  and  cognitive  decline,  independent  of  tau  burden.  In  contrast,  in  PS19  models  where the  R47H  variant  was  introduced  via  bacterial  artificial chromosome technology, investigators observed reduced tau  pathology,  attenuated  synaptic  loss,  and  decreased brain atrophy, accompanied by diminished inflammatory responses [105]. These discrepancies are likely driven by differences  in  the  disease  models  and  may  also  reflect sex-dependent  effects,  underscoring  the  complexity  of studying TREM2  R47H  in  tauopathies.  Importantly, studies  have  shown  that  the  TREM2  R47H  variant  disrupts splicing and decreases Trem2 mRNA and protein levels in mice, but not in humans [106]. As a result, generating  humanized TREM2 R47H knock-in mice would be crucial to better understand the cellular effects of the human TREM2 R47H coding variant.\n\nThe  interaction  between  TREM2  and  ApoE4  introduces  an  additional  layer  of  complexity  in  tauopathy. In  PS19  tauopathy  mice,  the  presence  of  the  TREM2 R47H  variant  exacerbates  brain  atrophy  specifically  in 9-  to  10-month-old  female  APOE4  mice,  while  male mice  remain  unaffected  [107].  Notably,  this  ventricular enlargement  is  absent  in  female  APOE3-TREM2  R47H tauopathy  mice,  suggesting  that  APOE  isoform  differences  influence  the  impact  of  TREM2  R47H  on  neurodegeneration.  The  exacerbated  brain  atrophy  is  further accompanied  by  increased  tau  hyperphosphorylation in  the  frontal  cortex,  indicating  a  potential  mechanistic  link  between  TREM2  dysfunction,  ApoE4,  and  tau pathology.  Mechanistically,  this  phenotype  is  associated with  an  amplified  microglial  response,  characterized  by heightened activation of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator  of  interferon  genes  (STING)  pathway  and  its  downstream  interferon  response.  This  dysregulated signaling cascade may contribute to microglial senescence, further accelerating tau pathology and neurodegeneration. Supporting this idea, in  PS19  mice expressing  APOE4,  complete  Trem2  knockout  exacerbates  neurodegeneration  and  tau  pathology,  suggesting that  TREM2-mediated microglial functions may exert a protective role in the presence of APOE4 [108]. This finding contrasts with earlier studies where Trem2 knockout in PS19 mice expressing mouse Apoe led to a reduction in tau pathology and neurodegeneration [102, 103], highlighting  a  context-dependent interplay between TREM2 and APOE isoforms in tauopathies.\n\nWhile large-scale genome-wide association studies  exploring  the  co-occurrence  of  APOE4  and  TREM2 R47H  alleles  in  AD  patients  remain  limited,  existing clinical  data  suggest  a  functional  interaction  between these  variants.  Individuals  carrying  both  APOE4  and TREM2  R47H  exhibit  a  shorter  disease  duration  compared  to  APOE4  carriers  without  TREM2  R47H  [109].\n\nAdditionally, one study reported that AD symptoms are more prevalent in individuals harboring both APOE4 and TREM2 R47H than in those carrying TREM2 R47H with APOE3, further suggesting that APOE4 may exacerbate TREM2  R47H-associated  vulnerability  [110].  However, a  separate  large-scale  analysis,  including  neuropathologically confirmed AD cases, found that a subset of individuals carrying only the TREM2 R47H variant-without APOE4-also  develop  AD  pathology  [111],  indicating that TREM2 R47H alone may be sufficient to drive disease progression in some cases.\n\nIn summary, the evidence strongly supports a protective  role  for  TREM2  in  amyloid-induced  tauopathy,  a model more closely resembling AD pathology. However,\n\nTREM2's  role  in  tauopathy  without  amyloid  pathology remains ambiguous and complex, with outcomes varying based  on  disease  context  and  models.  Further  research is  needed  to  fully  elucidate  how  TREM2  modulates  tau pathology, particularly in the presence of different genetic backgrounds and environmental factors.",

        "content": "The  biogenesis  of  sTREM2  is  a  multifaceted  process involving  two  primary  pathways:  proteolytic  shedding and alternative  splicing  (Fig.  3).  Proteolytic  shedding  of TREM2 is primarily mediated by enzymes of a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) family, with ADAM10 and\n\nFig. 3 Schematic illustration of sTREM2 production in microglia. This diagram illustrates two primary mechanisms underlying the generation of sTREM2: the proteolytic cleavage pathway and the splicing pathway. In the proteolytic cleavage pathway, the ectodomain of TREM2 is cleaved by metalloproteases, with ADAM10/17 cleaving at the H157-S158 bond and meprin β cleaving at the R136-D137 bond, resulting in the release of sTREM2 into the extracellular space. Alternatively, in the splicing pathway, mRNA variants of TREM2 are generated through splicing events, producing soluble forms of TREM2 that are also released extracellularly. Specifically, ENST00000373113 represents the canonical TREM2 transcript, consisting of five exons, while ENST00000338469 lacks exon 4, which encodes the transmembrane domain. Additionally, ENST00000373122 lacks exon 5 and has an alternative start site at exon 4, resulting in a different coding sequence. The box in the middle highlights the genetic modifiers influencing sTREM2 levels in the CSF\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nADAM17 being the key players in this  process  [15-17, 112, 113]. These enzymes cleave the extracellular domain of  TREM2 at the histidine 157-serine 158 (H157-S158) site, as confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis [15, 112, 113].  While  ADAM17  has  been  implicated  in  sTREM2 production  in  human  macrophages  and  CHO  cell  lines [15],  other  studies  emphasize  the  role  of  ADAM10  in TREM2 shedding in HEK293 cells and murine microglia [16,  112,  113].  The  exact  roles  of  ADAM10,  ADAM17, and  other  ADAM  family  members  in  sTREM2  generation are not yet fully understood, underscoring the need for  further  investigation  into  their  individual  contributions. In addition to ADAM proteases, meprin β, a zinc metalloproteinase from the astacin family, has been identified as an alternative sheddase [114]. It cleaves TREM2 at  a  distinct  arginine  136-aspartate  137  (R136-D137) site,  contributing to sTREM2 production particularly in macrophages. This highlights the diversity of proteolytic pathways involved in TREM2 shedding.\n\nAlongside proteolytic shedding,  sTREM2  can  also be  generated  via  alternative  splicing  of  TREM2  mRNA (Fig.  3).  This  process  produces  several  transcript  variants,  some  of  which  lack  the  transmembrane  domain, leading  to  the  generation  of  soluble  isoforms.  In  the human brain, four major TREM2 transcripts have been identified: ENST00000373113 (canonical transcript), ENST00000373122 (missing exon 5 and has an alternative start site at exon 4), ENST00000338469 (lacking exon 4),  and  TREM2Δe2  (missing  exon  2)  [14,  115].  Among these,  ENST00000338469,  which  lacks  the  transmembrane  domain,  represents  approximately  20-25%  of  the total TREM2 mRNA in the brain [14]. Notably, both the ENST00000338469 and ENST00000373122 isoforms are translated  and  secreted  as  sTREM2,  further  supporting the idea that alternative splicing plays a significant role in sTREM2 production [116].\n\nIn summary, sTREM2 is generated through two complementary mechanisms: (i) proteolytic shedding of the TREM2 ectodomain and (ii)  translation  of  alternatively spliced  TREM2  transcripts  lacking  the  transmembrane domain.  While  both  processes  contribute  to  sTREM2 production,  the  precise  balance  between  these  pathways and their individual roles in different cell types and conditions remain areas for further exploration. A more thorough  understanding  of  these  mechanisms  is  essential for elucidating the biological significance of sTREM2, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.",

        "content": "CSF levels of sTREM2 are notably elevated in neurodegenerative disorders, positioning sTREM2 as a dynamic biomarker  that  reflects  key  pathological  processes  in AD.  Consequently,  understanding  the  genetic  factors that  influence  sTREM2  levels  has  emerged  as  a  critical area of research, providing critical insights into their contributions to AD pathogenesis and potential avenues for therapeutic intervention. A major focus has been on variants within the TREM2 gene itself (Fig. 3). NHD and FTD-associated TREM2 variants, including Q33X, Y38C, and T66M, are associated with significantly reduced CSF sTREM2 levels compared to non-carriers [16, 117]. These reductions align with studies showing that such variants impair  the  cell-surface  localization  of  TREM2,  thereby decreasing its proteolytic shedding into sTREM2 [16]. In contrast, the AD-associated R47H variant is linked to elevated CSF sTREM2 levels, suggesting enhanced shedding or  altered  regulation  [117,  118].  Similarly,  the  H157Y variant  accelerates  TREM2  shedding,  further  highlighting  the  diverse  effects  of  TREM2  variants  on  sTREM2 dynamics [112, 119]. Collectively, these findings highlight the complex interplay between TREM2 genetic variants and the regulation of sTREM2 production, underscoring the importance of further research to better understand these  mechanisms  and  their  implications  for  neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nBeyond  variants  in  TREM2,  other  genetic  loci  have been identified as modifiers of sTREM2 levels, with the membrane-spanning  4-domains  subfamily  A  (MS4A) gene  cluster  being  particularly  significant.  MS4A  proteins are transmembrane receptors involved in cell activation  by  working  as  ion  channels  or  by  modulating the  signaling  of  other  immunoreceptors.  They  play  key roles in different pathological settings, including cancer, infectious  diseases,  and  neurodegeneration  [120].  Variants  such  as  rs1582763  in  the  MS4A  region  are  associated  with  increased  CSF  sTREM2  levels,  reduced  AD risk,  and  delayed  disease  onset  [121].  Conversely,  the rs6591561 variant, encoding the MS4A4A p.M159V protein,  is  linked  to  lower  CSF  sTREM2  levels,  heightened AD risk,  and  earlier  disease  onset.  Single-nucleus  transcriptomic analysis of brain tissue from carriers of these variants  identified  a  distinct  microglial  subpopulation regulated  by  MS4A4A  expression  [122].  The  protective variant enhances MS4A4A expression, shifting microglia toward  an  anti-inflammatory  state  characterized  by  the expression of interferon and lipid metabolism genes. In contrast, the risk variant in MS4A4A suppresses this cell state,  promoting  pro-inflammatory  cytokine  pathways and impairing lipid metabolism. These findings highlight a mechanistic link between MS4A4A regulation, microglial functions, and sTREM2 generation, presenting potential  therapeutic avenues targeting the MS4A pathway to modulate microglial resilience and AD progression.\n\nOther novel genetic modifiers of sTREM2  levels include  loci  associated  with  the  Transforming  Growth Factor Beta Receptor 2 (TGFBR2) and Nectin Cell Adhesion  Molecule  2  (NECTIN2)  genes  [123].  TGFBR2  is\n\na  receptor  for  TGF-β  signaling,  which  regulates  various cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation,  immune response, and fibrosis [124]. NECTIN2 is a  cell  adhesion  molecule  critical  for  forming  synaptic junctions,  immune  synapses,  and  viral  entry  [125].  Its genetic associations have been implicated in a variety of human  diseases,  including  AD,  coronary  heart  disease, and multiple sclerosis. Variants such as rs73823326 in the TGFBR2 region and rs11666329 in the NECTIN2 region have  been  linked  to  altered  CSF  sTREM2  levels  [123]. Lentivirus-mediated overexpression of NECTIN2  or TGFBR2 in macrophages derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells results in a significant increase in  extracellular  sTREM2  levels,  without  affecting  total TREM2 expression. This suggests the role of NECTIN2 and  TGFBR2  in  selectively  modulating  sTREM2  levels. Both genes are highly expressed in microglia and encode transmembrane  proteins,  suggesting  they  may  regulate CSF sTREM2 by influencing the proteolytic cleavage of TREM2  at  the  cell  membrane.  These  findings  emphasize  the  potential  of  NECTIN2  and  TGFBR2  as  novel therapeutic targets for AD, highlighting the importance of understanding genetic factors that influence sTREM2 levels in neurodegeneration.",

        "content": "The role of sTREM2 as a biomarker in AD has attracted significant  interest  due  to  its  capacity  to  reflect  neuroinflammatory  processes  and  track  the  stages  of  disease progression.  Cross-sectional  studies  consistently  show that CSF sTREM2 levels are elevated in AD patients compared  to  cognitively  normal  individuals,  supporting  its relevance in AD pathology [18, 19, 21, 117, 126]. Notably, sTREM2 levels exhibit stage-specific variation, peaking during the early symptomatic stages of AD (Fig. 4A). Data from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) reveals  that  sTREM2  levels  increase  in  familial AD mutation  carriers  up  to  five  years  before  and  after symptom onset [19], highlighting its potential as an early biomarker for neuroinflammatory changes that may precede clinical manifestations.\n\nThe  relationship  between  elevated  CSF  sTREM2  levels, cognitive function, and AD pathology has been well documented.  Studies  indicate  that  in  mild  cognitive impairment  (MCI)  patients,  higher  sTREM2  levels  correlate with increased gray matter volume in brain regions vulnerable  to  AD  [127].  Longitudinal  research  further shows that higher baseline sTREM2 levels are associated with slower cognitive decline over an 11-year period in AD  patients  who  test  positive  for  key  AD  biomarkers, such as Aβ42 and p-tau181 [21] (Fig. 4B). Additionally, a higher sTREM2 to p-tau181 ratio predicts a slower rate of progression from MCI to AD dementia. In autosomal dominant AD, elevated sTREM2 levels have been linked to  reduced  Aβ  pathology  and  slower  cognitive  decline, particularly  during  the  pre-symptomatic  phase,  further emphasizing  sTREM2's  potential  neuroprotective  role [23]. Interestingly, higher CSF sTREM2 levels also appear to mitigate the ApoE4-associated risk of cognitive decline and AD-related neurodegeneration, suggesting that\n\nFig. 4 Dynamic changes of sTREM2 across AD spectrum. ( A ) The levels of sTREM2 in CSF gradually increase throughout the AD continuum, correlating with microglial activation. This increase reaches its peak during the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage and subsequently plateaus or even declines in the dementia stage. ( B ) In elderly individuals, higher baseline CSF sTREM2 concentrations are associated with slower cognitive decline, particularly in memory and overall cognition. Furthermore, elevated sTREM2 levels correlate with a slower rate of hippocampal atrophy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFig. 5 (See legend on next page.)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(See figure on previous page.)\n\nFig. 5 Potential roles of sTREM2 in Alzheimer's disease pathology. The sTREM2, generated upon microglial activation, plays a crucial role in modulating AD pathology. It has been shown to inhibit Aβ oligomerization, fibrillization, and neurotoxicity. Additionally, sTREM2 promotes microglial activation, enhancing several microglial functions, including increased cell proliferation, migration, clustering around amyloid plaques, and the uptake and degradation of Aβ. These actions collectively reduce amyloid plaque burden and the number of dystrophic neurites. Additionally, sTREM2 interacts with transgelin-2 (TG2), leading to the deactivation of GSK3β and reducing tau phosphorylation. This process helps prevent neuronal loss and alleviates cognitive and behavioral impairments sTREM2 may have broader implications in neurodegenerative disease risk [128].\n\nWhile these findings highlight the importance of sTREM2  as  a  biomarker  in  AD,  it  remains  unclear whether  the  elevated  sTREM2  levels  reflect  an  overall  increase  in  TREM2  expression  due  to  inflammation, selective enhancement of proteolytic processing, or altered splicing of TREM2. The precise mechanisms contributing  to  the  dynamics  of  sTREM2  in  AD  pathogenesis warrant further exploration. Elevated sTREM2 levels may reflect increased proteolytic cleavage of TREM2 at the  cell  membrane,  potentially  regulated  by  factors  like MS4A4A, TGFBR2 or NECTIN2, which can selectively modulate sTREM2  shedding without affecting total TREM2  expression.  Alternatively,  changes  in  TREM2 splicing  could  also  contribute  to  higher  sTREM2  levels, although this remains to be investigated in more detail. Understanding  these  mechanisms  will  provide  deeper insight into the role of sTREM2 in AD and its potential for therapeutic targeting.\n\nTaken  together,  these  findings  underscore  the  complex  and  dynamic  role  of  sTREM2  in  AD  progression, positioning it as both a valuable biomarker and a potential  therapeutic  target.  Ongoing  longitudinal  studies  are critical to fully elucidate the mechanisms through which sTREM2 influences disease progression and to explore its application in therapeutic strategies aimed at modifying AD's trajectory.",

        "content": "sTREM2  plays  a  critical  role  in  neurodegenerative  diseases,  especially  AD,  by  influencing  both  amyloid  and tau pathologies (Fig. 5). Research suggests that sTREM2 functions  with  chaperone-like  activity,  helping  mitigate the toxic effects of Aβ [129]. In vitro studies have shown that sTREM2 preferentially binds to oligomeric forms of Aβ, inhibiting their aggregation and reducing the neurotoxic  effects  that  accelerate  disease  progression.  While these  findings  suggest  that  sTREM2  may  help  limit  the damaging consequences of Aβ accumulation, further in vivo studies are needed to confirm the relevance of this mechanism in AD brain. Conversely, the R47H variant of sTREM2 exhibits reduced binding affinity for Aβ oligomers, which could promote harmful Aβ aggregation and increase toxicity.\n\nIn  addition  to  its  role  in  modulating  Aβ  aggregation, sTREM2 plays a pivotal role in regulating key microglial functions,  including  survival,  proliferation,  migration, and phagocytosis. These processes are essential for maintaining  brain  homeostasis  and  mounting  an  effective response  to  pathological  changes  in  neurodegenerative diseases  such  as  AD.  Our  study  in  primary  microglial cultures  demonstrated  that  sTREM2  enhances  microglial survival through a PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway and stimulates the production of inflammatory cytokines via NF-κB  signaling  [130].  Importantly,  sTREM2  induces microglial  activation  in  the  mouse  brain  independently of full-length TREM2.  Furthermore, in the  5xFAD mouse  model,  sTREM2  promotes  microglial  proliferation, facilitates migration and clustering around amyloid plaques, and enhances the uptake and degradation of Aβ [20].  However,  the  R47H  variant  significantly  impairs sTREM2's ability to promote microglial survival and activate immune responses [130], which may contribute to a more aggressive disease course in AD patients carrying this variant.\n\nAdditional  evidence  supporting  the  protective  role  of sTREM2 in  AD  comes  from  in  vivo  experiments  using transgenic AD mouse models. Administration of recombinant sTREM2 to amyloidogenic mice has been shown to promote microglial clustering around amyloid plaques, which  may  reduce  neurite  dystrophy  associated  with these deposits [20] (Fig. 5). Moreover, sTREM2 reduces amyloid  plaque  load  and  improves  cognitive  function, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for preventing  or  reversing  amyloid  pathology  [20].  Interestingly, studies indicate that specific fragments of sTREM2 are  more  efficient  at  binding  Aβ  and  reducing  amyloid deposition  compared  to  full-length  sTREM2,  suggesting  that  these  selected  fragments  could  serve  as  more effective  therapeutic  interventions  [131].  Gene  therapy approaches involving adeno-associated virus  (AAV)mediated  overexpression  of  sTREM2  have  conferred significant  neuroprotection,  improving  brain  function and reducing amyloid pathology in transgenic mice [20]. In  contrast,  studies  using  transgenic  mice  with  altered TREM2 shedding-via  mutations  in  the  ADAM  protease cleavage site-reveal that reduced membrane TREM2 cleavage  exacerbates  amyloid  deposition  and  neuronal degeneration,  highlighting  the  importance  of  regulated TREM2 shedding for optimal brain health [132].\n\nIn  addition  to  its  role  in  amyloid  pathology,  sTREM2 has also been implicated in tau pathophysiology (Fig. 5). Elevated  CSF  levels  of  sTREM2  are  associated  with\n\nslower  tau  aggregation  in  Aβ-positive  individuals  who do  not  yet  exhibit  dementia,  suggesting  that  sTREM2 may delay tau-related neurodegeneration in the preclinical  stages  of  AD  [133].  Functional  magnetic  resonance imaging  (MRI)  analyses  further  support  these  findings, linking higher CSF sTREM2 levels to reduced tau deposition across key brain regions involved in AD. These data underscore  sTREM2's  potential  role  in  the  early  stages of tau pathology and its promise as a biomarker for taurelated  changes  in  AD.  In  PS19  mice,  AAV-mediated overexpression  of  sTREM2  significantly  attenuates  tau pathology, preventing tau aggregation and rescuing cognitive and behavioral deficits (Fig. 5). This reinforces the idea that increasing sTREM2 expression may offer therapeutic  benefits  against  tau-related  neurodegeneration [22].  Additionally,  sTREM2  has  been  shown  to  interact with transgelin-2 (TG2), deactivates the GSK3β and ameliorates tau phosphorylation. These findings suggest that sTREM2 plays a role in stabilizing tau, thereby reducing its neurotoxic effects.\n\nIn  summary, these findings highlight the dual protective roles of sTREM2 in both amyloid and tau pathologies in  AD.  By  modulating  immune  responses  and  mitigating  the  neurotoxic  aggregation  of  pathological  proteins, sTREM2 emerges as a promising therapeutic target. As research  advances,  sTREM2  may  play  a  pivotal  role  in the development of novel interventions aimed at slowing or even reversing the progression of AD. This positions sTREM2 not only as a biomarker for early disease detection but also as a potential therapeutic target for a range of  neurodegenerative  disorders.  Continued  exploration of the specific molecular mechanisms by which sTREM2 regulates  AD  pathology  will  be  crucial  for  developing therapeutic  strategies  that  promote  neuroprotection  in AD.",

        "content": "TREM2, both as a cell-surface receptor and in its soluble form,  has  emerged  as  a  pivotal  player  in  AD  and  other neurodegenerative disorders. Partial loss-of-function variants of TREM2 are strongly associated with increased AD risk, underscoring its protective role in maintaining microglial homeostasis. Concurrently, elevated CSF levels  of  sTREM2 have been correlated with slower cognitive  decline  and  attenuated  disease  progression,  further emphasizing its clinical significance. These findings collectively  highlight  TREM2  and  sTREM2  as  promising targets  for  therapeutic  intervention.  However,  the  precise mechanisms through which they modulate microglial functions and influence amyloid and tau pathologies remain incompletely understood, warranting further research.  Future  studies  should  focus  on  delineating the  molecular  mechanisms  that  regulate  TREM2  and sTREM2 and exploring their interplay with genetic and environmental factors.\n\nTherapeutic strategies targeting TREM2 and sTREM2 represent  complementary  approaches  with  significant potential in mitigating AD. Agonistic antibodies designed to activate TREM2 signaling have shown preclinical efficacy by enhancing microglial protective functions, reducing  amyloid  burden,  and  mitigating  neuroinflammation [13, 69, 96, 97, 134, 135]. These promising findings have led  to  ongoing  clinical  trials  evaluating  the  safety  and therapeutic benefits of TREM2 activation in AD patients [13].  Despite  these  promising  findings,  the  therapeutic modulation of TREM2 remains complex. While studies on  TREM2  deficiency  suggest  that  TREM2  constrains amyloid-induced tau pathology, chronic treatment with  the  agonistic  TREM2  antibody  AL002a  has  been reported to enhance the seeding and spreading of phosphorylated  tau,  exacerbating  neuritic  dystrophy  [136]. These findings underscore the context-dependent nature of TREM2-targeting therapies, highlighting the need for further  investigations  to  determine  the  optimal  timing, disease stage, and microglial functional states that shape treatment outcomes.\n\nMeanwhile, the neuroprotective properties of sTREM2 position it as an additional target for therapeutic development.  Both  preclinical  and  clinical  evidence  linking elevated sTREM2 levels to reduced amyloid and tau pathologies,  as  well  as  improved  cognitive  outcomes, underscores  the  rationale  for  interventions  aimed  at enhancing sTREM2 production or mimicking its protective effects. A combination of TREM2-targeted therapies and sTREM2-based interventions could potentially provide synergistic benefits for comprehensive disease modification.  However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  several TREM2 agonistic antibodies reportedly bind to the same epitope shared by full-length TREM2 and sTREM2 [69, 95].  This  interaction  may  interfere  with  the  protective functions  of  sTREM2,  warranting  careful  consideration in the design of therapeutic strategies.\n\nThe timing and context of these interventions are critical,  as  the  roles  of  TREM2  and  sTREM2  appear  to  be dependent  on  the  disease  stage.  Long-term  therapeutic strategies  must  take  into  account  these  stage-specific roles to maximize their efficacy. For example, during the early  stages  of  amyloid  seeding,  TREM2  signaling  plays a  crucial  role  in  facilitating  the  clearance  of  amyloid seeds,  thereby  preventing  further  plaque  formation  [82, 93]. However, its effects appear to be less pronounced in later stages of amyloid pathology. Similarly, sTREM2 levels  fluctuate in a stage-dependent manner, peaking during the early symptomatic phase of AD [18, 19]. Elevated sTREM2 levels have been associated with a reduction in Aβ accumulation and a slower rate of cognitive decline, particularly in the pre-symptomatic stage [21, 23]. These\n\nfindings  underscore  the  stage-specific  roles  of  TREM2 and  sTREM2  in  AD  pathology,  highlighting  the  importance  of  precise  therapeutic  timing  and  the  use  of  biomarkers  that  reflect  disease  progression  and  microglial activity to optimize intervention strategies.\n\nFrom  a  diagnostic  perspective,  sTREM2  shows  considerable potential as a biomarker for the early detection of  AD  and  for  monitoring  disease  progression.  Studies using TSPO-PET imaging have demonstrated a correlation between sTREM2 levels in CSF and TSPO signaling in  neurodegenerative  diseases  [69,  137],  indicating  that sTREM2 may serve as a potential marker for microglial activation.  Since  microglial  activation  is  an  early  and pivotal  event  in  the  pathogenesis  of  AD,  CSF  sTREM2 could  be  a  valuable  marker  for  monitoring  this  process in  clinical  settings.  Moreover,  sTREM2  levels  can  help distinguish AD patients at various stages of the disease, facilitating  more  tailored  and  personalized  treatment strategies.  Monitoring  sTREM2  levels  during  treatment may  enable  clinicians  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  a therapeutic intervention and make timely adjustments as needed. Additionally, elevated CSF sTREM2 levels have been suggested to be associated with a decreased risk of MCI-to-AD  conversion  [138].  Therefore,  CSF  sTREM2 levels  may  serve  as  a  predictor  of  cognitive  outcomes, enabling the identification of patients who are more likely to benefit from specific interventions and enhancing the precision of clinical decision-making.\n\nIn summary, TREM2 and sTREM2 represent interconnected  therapeutic  and  diagnostic  opportunities  in  AD. Advancing  our  understanding  of  their  roles,  regulatory mechanisms,  and  clinical  applications  will  enable  the development  of  targeted  interventions  that  can  modify disease  progression.  Integrating  these  insights  into  precision  medicine  strategies  holds  substantial  potential to  enhance  the  quality  of  life  for  patients  with  AD  and related neurodegenerative disorders.",
