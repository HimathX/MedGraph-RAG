## Abstract

Trillions of intestinal bacteria in the human body undergo dynamic transformations in response to physiological and pathological changes. Alterations in their composition and metabolites collectively contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease. The role of gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease is diverse and complex, evidence suggests lipid metabolism may be one of the potential pathways. However, the mechanisms that gut microbiota mediate lipid metabolism in Alzheimer's disease pathology remain unclear, necessitating further investigation for clarification. This review highlights the current understanding of how gut microbiota disrupts lipid metabolism and discusses the implications of these discoveries in guiding strategies for the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer's disease based on existing data.

## Background

Alzheimer's disease (AD), constituting 60-70% of dementia  cases,  is  the  most  prevalent  cause  of  dementia,  with global  estimates  surpassing  50  million  patients,  thereby imposing a substantial societal and familial burden [1].  Clinically,  AD  manifests  with  progressive  memory loss, cognitive impairment, and behavioral changes. Neuropathologically, β-amyloid (Aβ) deposits extracellularly, forming  neuroinflammatory  plaques, while

intracellularly,  excessive  phosphorylation  of  tau  leading  to  the  formation  of  neurofibrillary  tangles  (NFTs), accompanied  by  synaptic  loss  and  neurodegeneration [2-4]. Moreover, abnormalities in lipid metabolism have been  identified  as  the  third  pathological  feature  of  AD, associated  with  disease  onset  and  progression  [5].  Lipids, constituting 50% of the brain's weight, encompassing fatty  acids,  cholesterol,  phospholipids,  and  sphingolipids, play a pivotal role in brain function [6]. For instance, fatty acid oxidation contributes 20% of the brain's energy supply  [7],  and  cholesterol  and  sphingolipids  are  major components of lipid rafts [8, 9], playing crucial roles in neurotransmitter  transmission,  signal  transduction,  and neural synaptic plasticity. Alterations in lipid homeostasis  manifest  in  the  early  stages  of  AD  [10],  with  studies indicating abnormal lipid deposition in the brains of AD patients  and  3 × Tg  AD  mice,  signifying  disrupted  lipid metabolism  [11-14].  Concurrently,  a  systematic  review also encapsulated the prevalent occurrence of lipid

dysregulation in AD mouse models such as 5 × FAD, APP/ PS1,  among  others  [15].  Metabolic  analysis  of  serum, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid from AD patients reveals the dysregulation of lipid metabolism is closely linked to cognitive decline and neuronal dysfunction [16, 17].

The  gut  microbiota,  populating  the  human  gastrointestinal tract, consists of approximately 100 trillion bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, collectively  encoding over  3  million  genes  and  generating  a  diverse  array  of metabolites  [18].  Through  the  bidirectional  'gut-brain axis' [19, 20], the gut microbiota actively modulates host metabolic  processes  [21-24].  During  pathological  conditions,  dynamic  alterations  in  the  gut  microbiota  have been  observed  in  tandem  with  the  progression  of  the host's disease [25-27]. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of gut microbiota  in  AD  patients  reveals  a  reduction  in  both abundance and diversity [28-30], such as, the significant correlation between the increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and the severity and progression of AD has been observed [30]. The alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota have also been associated with Aβ and tau  pathological  biomarkers  [31].  Our  study  establishes Helicobacter  pylori (H.  pylori)  infection  as  a  risk  factor for AD [32, 33], 5 × FAD mice [34], and Tauopathy mouse model [25] has been provided. Chandra S and colleagues have  extensively  summarized  these  findings  [35].  Mezö et  al.  found  that  Germ-free  (GF)  5 × FAD mice enhance the  uptake  of  Aβ  deposits  by  hippocampal  microglia,  mitigating  plaque  burden  and  neuronal  loss,  and improving  memory  function  [36].  Antibiotic  treatment in  APP/PS1 mice also led to a reduction in Aβ deposition  [37].  Harach  et  al.  reached  the  same  conclusion  in GF  APP/PS1  mice  [38],  providing  compelling  evidence for  the  role  of  gut  microbiota  in  AD.  Transplanting  gut microbiota from AD mice into wild-type C57BL/6 mice results  in  impaired  memory  function  and  neurogenesis [39].  Conversely,  fecal  microbiota  transplantation  from healthy  mice  effectively  mitigates  Aβ  plaque  deposition and neurofibrillary tangle formation in AD mice, thereby ameliorating  cognitive  impairment  [40].  These  findings underscore the complex involvement of gut microbiota in AD pathology and suggest its potential as a therapeutic avenue for AD.

Emerging evidence suggests a significant interaction  between  gut  microbiota  and  lipid  metabolism  in AD  [41].  Such  as  correlations  were  observed  between gut  microbiota  and  fatty  acids  as  well  as  glycerophospholipids  in  APP/PS1  mice  [42].  A  recent  multi-omics study has unveiled the intricate connection between gut microbiota  and  host  glycerophospholipid  metabolism, as well as neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 mice [43, 44]. Additionally,  gut  microbiota  from  3 × Tg  mice  induced increased pro-inflammatory signal transduction through polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism [45]. Multi-strain probiotic  formulation  resulted  in  reduced  total  cholesterol  levels,  improved  lipid  metabolism,  and  enhanced cognitive  function  [46].  These  findings  present  compelling evidence for the involvement of gut microbiota in the lipid metabolism of AD.

Given  the  pivotal  roles  of  lipid  metabolism  and  gut microbiota  in  AD,  this  review  systematically  explores the  dysregulation  of  lipid  metabolism  in  the  context  of AD.  Subsequently,  it  emphasizes  the  intricate  interplay between gut microbiota and lipid metabolism during AD pathology, with a specific focus on gut microbiota metabolites, key genes, and molecular mechanisms. Lastly, the paper provides a comprehensive summary and analysis of current research pertaining to strategies aimed at modulating  gut  microbiota  and  lipid  metabolism,  to  improve the pathological progression of AD.

## Lipids dysregulation in Alzheimer's disease

Decades  of  research  have  unveiled  the  involvement  of lipid  metabolism  in  the  pathological  processes  of  AD. This  section  primarily  elucidates  the  changes  and  roles of  lipids  dysregulation  in  AD  pathology  from  the  perspectives  of  fatty  acids,  cholesterol,  phospholipids,  and sphingolipids.

## Fatty acids

Fatty  acids,  characterized  by  long  hydrocarbon  chains, are  categorized  into  saturated  fatty  acids  (SFAs)  and unsaturated  fatty  acids  (UFA),  which  encompass  both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) [47]. ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs),  including  docosahexaenoic  acid  (DHA)  and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), as well as ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-6 PUFAs) like arachidonic acid (AA), have been identified to play a significant role in AD [48]. Metabolomic analysis of post-mortem samples from the Baltimore  Longitudinal  Study  of  Aging  (BLSA)  cohort revealed  the  strongest  correlation  between  PUFAs  and AD  [49].  Current  research  suggests  that  ω-3  PUFAs, such as EPA and DHA, exert anti-inflammatory effects, mitigating  Aβ  deposition  and  improving  cognition  in AD  mice  [50].  DHA  as  the  most  abundant  PUFAs  in the  brain,  reduces  amyloid  production  and  inhibits  the aggregation  and  formation  of  amyloidogenic  fibrils  by decreasing  the  activity  of  γ-  and  β-secretase  enzymes, and its levels are significantly reduced in the brains and plasma  of  AD  patients  [49,  51,  52].  In  contrast  to  ω-3 PUFAs, ω-6 PUFAs are recognized as pro-inflammatory precursors, contributing to the synthesis of leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and thromboxane [53]. ω-6 PUFAs activate  GPR40  activation,  which  is  implicated  in  neuronal degeneration  and  death;  thus,  the  excessive  intake  of ω-6 PUFAs is considered a risk factor for AD [54]. AA, a plentiful ω-6 PUFA found in the gray matter of the brain,

exhibits heightened levels in individuals with AD, thereby fostering the generation and accumulation of Aβ through a  series  of  inflammatory  cascades.  Despite  the  prevailing perception of ω-3 PUFAs as protective elements for AD patients, it is crucial to recognize that both ω-3 and ω-6 PUFAs are integral to brain physiology. Therefore, it is imperative to uphold a judicious balance in the intake of ω-6/ω-3 PUFAs for optimal individual well-being [55].

SFAs  are  generally  considered  to  increase  the  risk  of AD [56]. Such as palmitic acid (PA), the most common SFAs in the brain, has been found to have elevated levels  in  the  temporal  and  frontal  cortices  of  AD  patients [57,  58]  PA  induces  SIRT1  dysfunction  and  activates the  NF-κB pathway [59]. Through SIRT1 inhibition, PA indirectly upregulates SREBP1 transcription and expression, leading to β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme  1(BACE1)  promoter  transactivation.  This  cascade results in increased BACE1 expression, heightened enzymatic activity, and elevated amyloid-beta generation. Additionally,  PA  induces  tau  hyperphosphorylation  and neuroinflammation [60].

## Cholesterol

In the presence of the blood-brain barrier, cerebral cholesterol primarily originates from endogenous synthesis. In brief, astrocyte-synthesized cholesterol, coupled with apolipoprotein  E  and  J,  is  secreted  through  ATP-binding  cassette  transporters,  followed  by  neuronal  uptake. Excessive  intracellular  free  cholesterol  is  enzymatically converted  into cholesterol ester (CE)  by cholesterol acyltransferase, leading to intracellular accumulation or plasma membrane efflux [5]. Increased brain cholesterol concentrations are regarded as a risk factor for AD due to the robust association with synaptic dysfunction and  impaired  neurotransmission,  as  evidenced  in  brain tissue  from  both  AD  patients  and  mouse  models  [61]. Post-mortem  examinations  of  AD  patients  revealed  an association between hypercholesterolemia and increased accumulation of Aβ in the brain [62]. The observed association could stem from blood-brain barrier impairment, resulting  in  an  augmented  cholesterol  influx  into  the brain  and  exacerbating  the  cerebral  cholesterol  burden. Subsequently, this mechanism accelerates Aβ aggregation within neurons and synaptic loss, thereby aggravating the pathological progression of AD [63].

A cholesterol-binding domain has been reported within the transmembrane domain of amyloid precursor protein  (APP),  suggesting  a  direct  interaction  between cholesterol and APP. Cholesterol upregulates the activity of γ-secretase, promoting the colocalization of APP with γ and β-secretases, thereby stimulating the generation of Aβ [64, 65]. A reduction in cholesterol may enhance nonpathogenic cleavage by α-secretase, consequently reducing Aβ production [66]. In addition, CE can bind to the cholesterol-binding  domain on APP, affecting APP processing and Aβ production. In contrast to the Aβ regulation, CE regulate the phosphorylation of tau in neurons through  a  proteinase-pTau  axis.  The  reduction  in  CE generation leads to a decrease in the expression levels of phosphorylated tau at multiple sites [67].

## Phospholipid

Phospholipids form the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, acting  as  a  safeguarding  barrier  for  cellular  and  subcellular  structures.  They  also  participate  in  maintaining homeostasis,  managing  immune  responses,  oxidative stress  and  neuroinflammation  in  the  brain.  The  main brain  phospholipids  are  phosphatidylcholine  (PC)  and phosphatidylethanolamine  (PE)  [68].  There  have  been reports that the lyso-PC to PC ratio decreases, and watersoluble  PC  metabolites  increase  in  individuals  with  AD [69].  Indeed,  increased  levels  of  glycerophosphocholine and decreased levels of lysoPC(18:1(11Z)), PC (16:0/16:0) and phosphatidylcholine were observed in the brains of APP/PS1 transgenic  mice  [43].  This  suggests  that  there is  more  hydrolysis  of  phospholipids  during  the  course of AD. The degradation of PC and PE is considered as a significant metabolic anomaly in AD, with the decreased concentrations being closely associated with the severity of amyloid protein and neurofibrillary pathology [70-72]. Moreover,  there  is  a  substantial  70%  decrease  in  ethanolamine plasmalogens (PlsEtns) in AD patients, which exert  neuroprotective  effects  by  activating  G-protein coupled  receptors  (GPCRs),  increasing  AKT  and  ERK pathway  phosphorylation,  preventing  neuronal  death, reducing γ-secretase activity, and decreasing Aβ production [73, 74]. Additionally, mice deficient in PlsEtns have increased activity of the tau phosphorylating kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β), possibly leading to excessive tau phosphorylation [75].

Another  noteworthy  phospholipid is Phosphatidylserine  (PtdSer),  constituting  13-15%  of  phospholipids in  the  human  cerebral  cortex  [76].  PtdSer  serves  as  an indispensable  participant  in  signal  transduction,  asymmetrically  distributed  on  the  leaflet  of  the  lipid  bilayer [77]. PtdSer on the inner leaflet of the membrane facilitates  the  activation  of  signaling  proteins  and  receptors crucial for neuronal survival, differentiation, and synaptic neurotransmission [78]. Externalized phosphatidylserine (ePtdSer) serves as one of the ligands for The Triggering Receptor  Expressed  on  Myeloid  Cells  2  (TREM2)  [79]. ePtdSer exposed on synaptic surfaces acts as an 'eat-me' signal, facilitating microglia-mediated synapse pruning  [80]  and  phagocytic  activity  [81].  In  Nondemented individuals with AD neuropathology (NDAN), microglia induced by ePtdSer-TREM2 exhibit enhanced efficiency in  clearing  damaged  synapses,  which  may  underlie  the synaptic  structural  and  functional  integrity  in  NDAN

individuals,  thus  preventing  cognitive  impairment  [82]. Under  oxidative  stress  conditions  of  AD,  the  asymmetry of PtdSer is disrupted, evidenced by increased exposure of PtdSer in the outer leaflets of the frontal cortex in  individuals  with  Mild  Cognitive  Impairment  (MCI) and AD, initiating early apoptosis and ultimately leading to  increased  neuronal  damage  [77].  Another  study  suggests that in the early stages of AD, the release of ePtdSer  serves  as  an  'eat-me'  signal,  prompting  microglia to  preferentially  eliminate  ePtdSer + damaged  synapses through  TREM2,  thereby  maintaining  neural  and  synaptic  homeostasis.  However,  microglia  expressing  dysfunctional  R47H  TREM2  fail  to  phagocytose  ePtdSer + synapses,  resulting  in  increased  apoptotic-like  synaptic burden in the hippocampus [83].

## Sphingolipids

Sphingolipids,  which  are  essential  components  of  neuronal  cell  membranes,  include  bioactive  lipids  such  as ceramide (Cer), sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and sphingosine,  and  are  involved  in  the  regulation  of  neuronal stress, proliferation, differentiation and maturation [84].  Metabolomic  analysis  of  brain  and  blood  in  preclinical and prodromal stages of AD shows a correlation between decreased sphingolipid levels and the severity of AD pathology [71, 85, 86]. Blood sphingolipid concentrations  correlate  with  cerebrospinal  fluid  Aβ  levels,  brain atrophy and cognitive decline, suggesting the potential of sphingolipids as early biomarkers of AD [71].

Ceramides which increased in the brain tissue  of  AD patients  [87]  contribute  to  the  stability  of  BACE1  and facilitate  the  excessive  generation  of  Aβ  [88].  Neurons accelerate Aβ aggregation by releasing extracellular vesicles  rich  in  ceramides,  while  inhibition  or  silencing  of neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (nSMase2), which is responsible  for  vesicle  secretion,  has  been  shown  to  improve Aβ plaque formation, slow the pathological progression of AD and improve cognitive function [89]. In addition, S1P,  recognized  for  its  neuroprotective  effects,  exhibits decreased levels in the brain tissues of both AD patients and 5 × FAD mice, potentially accelerating neuronal degeneration [87, 89].

## Gut microbial metabolites regulate AD lipids and pathology

Gut  microbiota  generate  diverse  metabolites,  including short-chain  fatty  acids,  bile  acids,  lipopolysaccharides, trimethylamine, tryptophan metabolites, and more. These metabolites serve as signaling molecules and substrates  within  the  host,  thereby  regulating  host  physiological  functions  [90].  Fluctuations  in  gut  microbiota coincide  with  alterations  in  metabolite  levels  throughout  the  progression  of  AD.  Several  studies  have  elucidated the regulatory role of bacterial metabolites in lipid metabolism, shedding light  on  their  involvement  in  the progression  of  AD  pathology  (Fig.  1).  This  section  provides a comprehensive summary of studies in the literature investigating the impact of bacterial metabolites on lipid metabolism and pathological progression in AD.

## Short chain fatty acids

Gut  microbiota  enzymatically  degrades  carbohydrates and  plant  polysaccharides  to  produce  SCFAs,  particularly  acetate,  propionic  acid,  and  butyrate,  which  collectively constitute about 95% of the total SCFAs in the human body. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes preferentially generate  propionate, Firmicutes ( Eubacterium , Anaerostipes , Roseburia ,  and Faecalibacterium  prausnitzii )  are well-defined  as  the  predominant  producers  of  butyrate. Akkermansia muciniphila has the unique ability to utilize intestinal  mucin  as  its  sole  carbon  and  nitrogen  source for proliferation, with propionate as a central metabolite. These  SCFAs  have  the  capacity  to  traverse  the  bloodbrain  barrier  or  the  gut-brain  axis,  exerting  regulatory effects on neurotransmitter synthesis, mitochondrial function, lipid metabolism, and gene expression [44].

Targeted  metabolomics  analysis  of  feces  from  AD patients indicates a reduction in the levels of SCFAs-producing phyla such as Firmicutes , Clostridia , and Ruminococcus ,  resulting  in  decreased  SCFAs levels [91]. SCFAs play a pivotal role in AD pathology through Ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) signaling [92]. Specifically,  SCFAs  bind  to  GPR43  and  GPR109A  receptors, modulate cholesterol and lipid metabolism, activate MAPK pathway,  and  suppress  NF-κB  pathway  [93].  In addition,  studies  have  explored  the  functions  and  roles of individual SCFA in AD, such as, acetate up-regulates GPR41  expression,  inhibits  the  ERK/JNK/NF-κB  pathway,  alleviates  neuroinflammation,  and  improves  cognition  in  APP/PS1 mice [94]. Additionally, propionic acid binds  to  GPR41  in  brain  endothelial  cells,  hinders  lowdensity lipoprotein receptor-related protein  1(LRP-1) expression through a CD14-dependent mechanism, and shields the blood-brain barrier from oxidative stress via NRF2  signaling  [95].  Furthermore,  epigenetics  represents  one  of  the  mechanisms  by  which  SCFAs  impact AD.  Butyrate,  acting  as  a  histone  deacetylase  inhibitor, has demonstrated the ability to elevate the expression of genes associated with learning,  restore  histone  acetylation,  and  markedly enhance  learning  and  memory  ability  in  AD  mice  [96], acetate  also  enhances  cognition  by  facilitating  histone H3K18 acetylation [97].

Furthermore,  Colombo  et  al.  observed  a  significant reduction in Aβ plaque burden in the brains of GF APP/ PS1 mice compared to specific pathogen-free (SPF) APP/ PS1 mice, with improved cognitive performance in spatial  memory  tasks.  Subsequent  investigations  revealed

Fig. 1 The potential association between gut microbiota and their metabolites with lipid dysregulation in AD. Throughout the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is a reduction in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). PC exhibits a negative correlation with the severity of AD pathology, while PE serves as a prognostic indicator for patients with mild cognitive impairment. Plasmalogens (PlsEtns) mitigate tau phosphorylation and experience downregulation in AD. Cholesterol, a pivotal lipid in AD, notably increases in the brain, accompanied by a significant elevation in cholesterol esters (CE). Cholesterol and CE play pivotal roles in AD, contributing to Aβ pathology, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. Gut microbiota metabolites such as BAs, SCFAs, and LPS interact with cholesterol, thereby modulating AD pathology. Ceramide (Cer) levels escalate in AD, stabilizing BACE1 and fostering Aβ production, whereas sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) exhibits neuroprotective effects, and its decrease facilitates neurodegeneration. Tryptophan metabolites (TRYCATs) are intricately associated with sphingolipids through the AhR receptor. Fatty acids like docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) decrease in AD, playing a role in inhibiting Aβ generation. Arachidonic acid (AA) is a prominent participant in neuroinflammation, instigating neuronal degeneration. Palmitic acid (PA), a representative saturated fatty acid, fosters AD through heightened β-secretase activity and tau hyperphosphorylation. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) exacerbates AD progression by promoting fatty acid oxidation and oxidative stress

that the increased concentration of SCFAs in the plasma of SPF mice was the primary cause of this outcome, contrary to prior findings; supplementation of SCFAs simulated the role of the microbiota and increased Aβ plaque burden [98]. Erny and colleagues also demonstrated that acetate treatment exacerbated Aβ plaque deposition and neuroinflammation in GF 5 × FAD mice [99]. In addition, recent  investigation  demonstrated  that  SCFAs  act  as mediators in the neuroinflammation-neurodegeneration axis, intensifying reactivity in neural glial cells and exacerbating  p-tau  pathology  in  TE4  P301S  tau  transgenic mice [100]. Nevertheless, the experimental findings reported by Zhou et al. indicate that dietary supplementation  with  high  acetate  and  butyrate  (HAMSAB)  may attenuate  cognitive  decline  in  5 × FAD mice [101],  highlighting a potential protective role of endogenous SCFA. These  findings  suggest  the  paradoxical  roles  and  functions of SCFAs in AD under different circumstances. Further studies are essential to gain a deeper understanding of the effects of SCFAs on AD. While the role of SCFAs remains controversial,  their  significance  as  key  molecular  mediators in the gut-brain axis of AD is undeniable.

Modulation  of  SCFAs  and  their  related  pathways  may represent  promising  therapeutic  targets  in the early peripheral circulation of AD.

## Bile acids

Bile acids (BAs) can be further subdivided into primary Bas and secondary Bas; the primary Bas consist of cholic  acid  (CA)  and  chenodeoxycholic  acid  (CDCA)  [102, 103]. The bile salt hydrolase, which are produced in the intestine by Bacteroides , lostridium cluster VIA, Lactobacillus , and Bifidobacterium , transform primary bile acids into secondary bile acids, which include deoxycholic acid (DCA),  lithocholic  acid  (LCA),  and  cholic  ursodeoxycholic  acid  (UDCA)  [102,  104].  Primary  bile  acids  are responsible for lipid absorption and maintaining cholesterol homeostasis, as they can penetrate the blood-brain barrier  (BBB)  and  bind  to  nuclear  receptors  to  regulate brain  physiological  functions.  A  multicenter  metabolomic study involving 1464 participants found that in the serum  metabolome  of  AD  patients,  DCA  and  its  conjugated  forms  with  glycine  and  taurine  increased,  and deoxycholic acid was associated with decreased cognitive abilities  [104].  Another  metabolomic  analysis  revealed that  the  alternative  synthesis  pathway  of  bile  acids  is more active in individuals with AD, and increased serum concentrations of cytotoxic bile acids [103, 105], indicating that dysregulation of bile acid metabolism caused by gut microbiota imbalance is involved in the pathological process of AD.

In  addition,  some  BAs  have  been  reported  to  exhibit neuroprotective effects. A recent systematic review summarized  that  UDCA  reduces  the  levels  of  ROS,  tumor necrosis  factor  alpha  (TNFα),  and  interleukin-1  beta (IL-1β), exerting anti-apoptotic, oxidative stress and inflammatory  effects  in  AD  [106].  In  addition,  tauroursodeoxycholic  acid  (TUDCA)  reduces  Aβ  deposition, inhibits  the  progression  of  amyloid  pathology  and  suppresses GSK3β activity, thereby reducing tau hyperphosphorylation and microglial cell activation [107]. Further research has confirmed that TUDCA can bind to the G protein-coupled  bile  acid  receptor  1/Takeda  G  proteincoupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) in microglial cells, increasing  cAMP  levels,  inducing  an  anti-inflammatory phenotype of microglial cells, and attenuating inflammatory responses [108]. These findings indicate the potential therapeutic effects of TUDCA in AD [109, 110].

## Lipopolysaccharides

Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), endotoxins produced by intestinal gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli , Bacteroides fragilis , and Salmonella enterica , were found to  coexist  with E.  coli fragments  in  amyloid  plaques  in postmortem brain tissues of AD patients [111]. Furthermore, the blood levels of LPS were significantly increased in AD patients, and the presence of LPS was also detected in the neocortex and hippocampus of AD patients at levels  more  than  seven  times  higher  than  control  subjects [112]. These findings indicate that LPS is widely present in the brains of AD patients and may represent a risk factor for cognitive impairment and the progression of AD [113].

The role of LPS in the pathophysiology of AD has been extensively documented [113]. LPS can disrupt the intestinal and blood-brain barriers, triggering a robust inflammatory response in the brain, promoting Aβ deposition, and inducing excessive phosphorylation of tau [111, 114]. Furthermore,  it  upregulates  the  activity  of  APP  cleaving enzyme BACE-1 and γ-secretase while reducing the activity of α-secretase, thus promoting Aβ generation. It also  induces  neuroinflammation  in  microglia  cells  and impairs cognitive function of AD mice in a CatB-dependent  manner  [115].  Meanwhile,  LPS  downregulates  the expression  of  LRP-1,  impairs  P-glycoprotein  function, and  disrupts  Aβ  clearance  through  multiple  pathways. LRP-1  is  the  primary  metabolic  receptor  for  APOE  in the  brain  and  involved  in  APOE-mediated  lipid  transport processes [116], indicating that LPS may indirectly regulate the function of APOE. Additionally, LPS induces oxidative  stress  and  mitochondrial  dysfunction  through NOX2,  leading  to  neuronal  damage  and  synaptic  loss [113].

Furthermore, an important point not to be overlooked regarding LPS is its close association with microglial activation and neuroinflammation [117, 118]. LPS serves as a receptor agonist for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is  considered  one  of  the  key  receptors  involved  in  the innate immune system of microglia [119], promoting the production  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  and  increasing Aβ accumulation [120]. Additionally, LPS can interact with  TREM2  to  modulate  microglial  phenotype  transition from anti-inflammatory to pro-inflammatory [121]. Therefore, LPS-induced neuroinflammation is also a crucial factor in promoting neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in AD.

From the perspective of lipid metabolism, research has shown that LPS can induce the expression of microglial Cholesterol  25-hydroxylase  (CH25H)  [122].  CH25H  is an  enzyme  responsible  for  hydroxylating  cholesterol  to produce oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), which is upregulated in brain tissues of AD patients, as well as in  APP/PS1 and PS19 mouse brain tissues [123]. Regulation  of  CH25H  by  LPS  results  in  increased  synthesis and release of 25-HC, which in turn activates LXR gene expression  and  inhibits  SREBP  expression,  enhancing cholesterol esterification and lipid droplet accumulation in astrocytes [124]. Further studies have found that LPSmediated activation of 25-HC disrupts mouse hippocampal plasticity and memory learning function [122]. Given

the evidence that Gram-negative bacteria and LPS impact various AD pathologies, Gram-negative bacteria and LPS represent attractive novel targets for AD therapy.

## Trimethylamine N-oxide

The  anaerobic  bacteria  in  the  gut  microbiota,  such  as Clostridia and Enterobacteriaceae , degrade  carnitine, choline, and lecithin to produce trimethylamine (TMA), which is subsequently oxidized and reduced in the liver to generate Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) [103, 125]. Elevated levels of TMAO have been found in the cerebrospinal  fluid  of  patients  with  mild  cognitive  impairment and AD, and are associated with pathological markers of AD  including  tau  phosphorylation,  Aβ  deposition,  and neurodegeneration [126].

TMAO  activates the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome to induce inflammatory responses  through  SIRT3-SOD2-mtROS  pathway  [127]. TMAO  also  influences  lipid  and  hormone  homeostasis,  regulates  cholesterol  and  steroid  metabolism,  and reduces  cholesterol  reverse  transport,  thereby  promoting  the  development  of  various  diseases  [128].  Furthermore, TMAO affects the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle by decreasing ketone and fatty acid oxidation, thus lowering  energy  metabolism  and  inhibiting  mitochondrial function.  Researchers  observed  that  TMAO  promotes the  downregulation  of  synaptic  plasticity-related  proteins  and  mTOR  signaling  pathway  expression,  leading to  mitochondrial  damage  and  superoxide  production, impairing synapses, and causing a decline in mice cognitive function [129]. Decreasing plasma TMAO levels has been  shown  to  reduce  the  expression  of  pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, IL-17, and TNF-α, alleviate the hippocampal inflammation in APP/PS1 mice, and improve the cognitive ability and pathological progression [130].

## Tryptophan catabolites

Tryptophan (TRP), an indispensable aromatic amino acid obtained from dietary source [131], undergoes regulation by the intestinal microbiota [132]. Through liquid chromatography  metabolomics  analysis,  significant  differences were found in tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs) between AD patients and healthy controls,  indicating  a link  between  cognitive  impairment  in  AD  patients  and dysregulated tryptophan metabolism resulting from microbial imbalance [91]. TRYCATs have been shown to stimulate  neurogenesis  in  mice  through  an  aryl  hydrocarbon  receptor  (AhR)-dependent  manner  [133,  134]. Furthermore,  AhR  is  intricately  linked  to  sphingolipid metabolism, as it upregulates sphingolipid and S1P levels,  thereby  contributing  to  the  maintenance  of  axonal myelination [135, 136]. These findings suggest a potential connection between tryptophan metabolism and sphingolipid metabolism in AD.

Indole,  the  principal  microbial  metabolite  originating  from  tryptophan  degradation  in  adult  organisms, assumes a crucial neuroprotective role in AD by modulating  inflammatory  responses,  preserving  gut  barrier integrity,  and  regulating  immune  homeostasis  [137]. Notably,  a  diminished  abundance  of  indole-producing bacteria, including Firmicutes , Bacteroidetes , Actinobacteria ,  and Lactobacilli ,  was  observed  in  AD  patients [91],  concomitant with a significant reduction in indole levels  [138].  Indole-3-propionic  acid  (IPA),  synthesized by Clostridium sporogenes , is capable of intestinal absorption and entry into the brain, where it serves to scavenge hydroxyl radicals,  reduce  DNA damage, and inhibit the formation  of  amyloid  fibrils  [137].  Indole  compounds exhibit  neuroprotective  effects  due  to  their  antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,  immunomodulatory,  and  anti-amyloidogenic  properties,  gradually  emerging  as  candidate drugs  for  improving  neurodegenerative  diseases.  Relevant  drug  development  efforts  are  currently  underway [139]. The indole compound NC009-1 has been shown to improve cognitive deficits of 3 × Tg-AD mice by upregulating the expression of APOE and tropomyosin receptor kinase A and reducing the levels of Aβ and tau in the hippocampus and cortex [140].

Besides,  metabolomic  analyses,  both  untargeted  and targeted, of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) derived from individuals with AD unveiled a specific dysregulation in the tryptophan-kynurenic  acid  pathway  within  the  central nervous  system.  Notably,  tryptophan  catabolic  metabolites,  namely  kynurenic  acid  and  quinolinic  acid,  exhibited  elevated  concentrations in the CSF of AD patients. Moreover, these metabolites demonstrated a robust correlation  with  the  core  pathological  amyloid  proteins Aβ42 and phosphorylated Tau181 [141].

## Gut microbiota metabolites interact with key genes of AD lipid metabolism

Genome-wide  association  studies  (GWAS)  have  pinpointed  risk  genes  for  AD,  including  apolipoprotein  E (APOE),  clusterin  (also  referred  to  as  apolipoprotein  J, CLU), and ATP-binding cassette sub-family A, members 1  and  7  (ABCA1/7).  These  genes  play  a  central  role  in lipid  metabolism  and  their  alterations  contribute  to  the development of lipid metabolism disorders in AD [142144].  Furthermore,  SREBP-2  is  also  a  key  regulator  of cholesterol metabolism and is genetically associated with an altered risk of AD [145]. Numerous studies indicates that the gut microbiota and its metabolites interact with these key lipids genes and participate in the pathological progression of AD (Fig. 2). Therefore, this section focuses on summarizing the above-mentioned content.

Fig. 2 The connection mechanisms between gut microbiota and pathology of Alzheimer's disease. The dysregulation of gut microbiota compromises the integrity of the intestinal and blood-brain barriers, allowing gut microbiota metabolites to enter the central nervous system and participate in the pathological processes of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Astrocytes within the central nervous system synthesize lipids through key genes such as SREBP , APOE, ABCA1, CLU, ABCA7, TREM2, transferring them to neurons and microglial cells. Microbial metabolites can interact with these genes, influencing lipid homeostasis. Furthermore, gut microbiota metabolites primarily contribute to AD pathology through involvement in Aβ pathology, tau pathology, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and epigenetic regulation. SCFAs binding to GPR41, dependent on CD14 expression, inhibits NRF2 signaling, reducing oxidative stress in endothelial cells, maintaining the blood-brain barrier. In contrast, LPS binding to TLR4 promotes Myd88 expression, activating NF-κB transcription, releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, damaging the blood-brain barrier. For Aβ Pathology: LPS reduces α-secretase activity, promoting APP production, while both LPS and TMAO upregulate BACE-1 and γ-secretase activities, enhancing Aβ production. SCFAs and TUDCA promote α-secretase activity and inhibit Aβ generation. Tau Pathology: SCFAs and TUDCA inhibit GSK-3β activity by promoting AKT phosphorylation, thereby suppressing tau phosphorylation, and reducing NFTs formation. Neuroinflammation: SCFAs upregulate GPR41 expression, inhibit the ERK/JNK/NF-κB pathway, reducing COX2 and IL-1β levels, alleviating neuroinflammation. TUDCA binds to the TGR5 receptor in microglial cells, increases cAMP levels, inhibits the NF-κB pathway, induces an anti-inflammatory phenotype, and mitigates inflammation. Indole reduces NLRP3 inflammasome expression through the AhR/NF-κB pathway, decreasing the release of inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-18, inhibiting microglia-induced neuroinflammation. TREM2 activates the PI3K/AKT/Foxo3a pathway, suppressing the inflammatory response. Conversely, downregulation of TREM2 expression by LPS leads to an increased inflammatory response. LPS also activates TLR4 and NF-κB transcription, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β. Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Function: SCFAs binding to GPR109A blocks NF-κB signaling, reducing neuronal oxidative stress levels. SCFAs binding to sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter 1 (SMCT1) or activating GPR41 promotes NRF2, leading to increased SOD1 production and inhibition of NOX2, preventing excessive accumulation of neuronal ROS. Indole binds to respiratory chain complex enzymes, reducing mitochondrial electron leakage, neutralizing hydroxyl radicals, and inhibiting ROS production. Epigenetic Regulation: SCFAs inhibit HDAC activity, promoting excessive acetylation of histone H3K18, improving cognition. Alternatively, SCFAs promote histone acetylation, restoring synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in an ACSS2-dependent manner

## APOE

APOE functions as a lipid transport protein with a crucial  role  in  the  central  nervous  system,  and  its  significance and functions in the context of Alzheimer's disease have been extensively documented in numerous research studies  [146-149].  APOE  facilitates  the  transport  of cholesterol  and  lipids  between  astrocytes  and  neurons by interacting with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and LDLR-related protein 1 (LRP1). This mechanism is pivotal in synaptic formation and tissue repair

processes  [147].  With  its  three  main  isoforms,  APOE exhibits a range of effects. APOE2 exhibiting a protective effect,  APOE3  playing  a  neutral  role,  while  the  APOE4 allele  increases  the  risk  of  developing  AD  by  approximately 12 times in homozygous individuals [150]. Consequently, APOE4 is considered the most potent risk factor for  late-onset  Alzheimer's  disease  (LOAD)  [114,  151, 152].

In-depth  analyses  of  the  gut  microbiota  in  AD  mice with  different  APOE  genotypes,  utilizing  16S  rRNA sequencing  and  fecal  metabolomics,  have  revealed  correlations  between  APOE  genotypes  and  the  abundance of  gut  microbiota.  Specifically,  APOE2  genotype  mice displayed higher levels of Ruminococcaceae and Prevotellaceae ,  bacterial families involved in SCFAs production. This  is  thought  to  contribute  to  the  protective  effect  of the  APOE2  genotype  against  AD.  In  APOE4  genotype AD  mice,  an  increase  in Lachnospiraceae and Deferribacteraceae ,  and  a  decrease  in Bacteroidaceae were observed,  accompanied  by  reduced  concentrations  of SCFAs and their precursors [153]. These findings suggest that  APOE  genotypes  influence  the  composition  of  the gut microbiota and the generation of metabolites in AD mice.  Changes  of  microbiota  and  metabolites  induced by  different  APOE  genotypes  may  play  an  important role in the impact of APOE genes on AD. Carriers of the APOEε4  allele  often  experience  disturbances  in  CNS cholesterol  homeostasis,  and  APOE4  mice  also  exhibit abnormal  cholesterol  levels  and  lipid  metabolism  disruptions [153]. This suggests that the gut microbiota and SCFAs may influence CNS cholesterol levels by affecting APOE gene.

Moreover,  the  microbiota  and  its  metabolites  also influence APOE genes. For instance, the microbiota-produced secondary bile acid TUDCA reduce the expression of APOE in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, inhibiting  the  production  and  accumulation  of  Aβ  [154].  In the presence of melatonin, APOE4's characteristics shift from promoting amyloid fibril formation to inhibiting it [137]. Additionally, the gut microbiota reduces neuroinflammation, tau pathology, and neurodegeneration in an APOE  genotype-specific  manner  [100].  These  findings highlight  the  significant  interplay  between  the  microbiota, its metabolites, and APOE genes in AD.

## TREM2

TREM2  is  a  transmembrane  receptor  of  the  immunoglobulin  superfamily  specifically  expressed  in  microglial  cells  of  the central nervous system. It plays a role in microglial proliferation, transportation, phagocytic functions,  and  inflammatory  responses  [155,  156].  When functional  loss  mutations,  such  as  R47N,  R62H,  and D87N,  occur  in  TREM2,  the  risk  of  developing  LOAD increases. These mutations result in reduced cholesterol clearance  by  microglial  cells,  decreased  uptake  of  CLU, LDL,  and  Aβ,  exacerbating  cholesterol  lipid  accumulation,  amyloid  pathology,  and  neuronal  damage  [81, 157-159].

Research  has  reported  a  close  association  between bacterial anionic LPS and TREM2. LPS bind to TREM2 [160],  promoting  the  transition  of  microglial  cells  from an  anti-inflammatory  phenotype  to  a  pro-inflammatory phenotype  [161].  A  study  in  BV2  cells  confirmed  that LPS  reduces  TREM2  expression,  promotes  the  translocation  of  Foxo3a  from  the  cytoplasm  to  the  nucleus, triggering an inflammatory response. Conversely, upregulation  of  TREM2  expression  can  activate  the  PI3K/ AKT/Foxo3a axis, inhibiting pro-inflammatory factors  and  shifting  microglial  cells  toward  an  M1  phenotype  [162].  Moreover,  TREM2  facilitates  the  expression of  Sirtuin3,  suppressing  LPS-induced  oxidative  stress and  neuroinflammation  [163].  The  deletion  of  TREM2 results in a substantial increase in inflammatory mediators, including Cxcl10, Rac2, and Casp1, upon exposure to  LPS,  thereby  fostering  the  initiation  of  inflammatory responses [164].

## ABCA1/7

ATP-binding  cassette  subfamily  A  (ABCA)  belongs  to the  ATP-binding  cassette  transporter  family,  mediating the export of cholesterol and phospholipids in the brain. Notably, rare variants of ABCA1 and ABCA7 have been identified  as  risk  genes  for  AD  [64].  ABCA1  transports cholesterol,  phospholipids, and other lipid molecules to lipoprotein carriers [165] and facilitates the distribution of cholesterol from astrocytes to neurons, protecting cells from the toxic effects of excessive free cholesterol [166]. Simultaneously, ABCA1 is responsible for lapidating the APOE  protein  in  the  brain.  The  deficiency  of  ABCA1 results in impaired APOE lipidation, leading to increased Aβ  plaque  load,  while  overexpression  of  ABCA1  can reduce  Aβ  deposition  [167,  168].  Research  indicates that  the  gut  microbiota  metabolite  butyrate  activates the expression of ABCA1, promoting cholesterol efflux, thereby  improving  lipid  metabolism  in  APOE -/ -mice [169].  TMAO  has  been  demonstrated  to  downregulate the  expression  of  ABCA1,  promoting  cholesterol  accumulation [170, 171].

ABCA7, sharing  54%  homology  with  ABCA1,  is  currently recognized for its involvement in facilitating lipid transport  from  neurons  to  glial  cells,  providing  protection to neurons against oxidative lipid damage. Ongoing research suggests that ABCA7 also plays a crucial role in cholesterol transport and phagocytosis by microglial cells [172, 173]. Conversely, the absence or functional impairment  of  ABCA7  may  intensify  fatty  acid  consumption, disturb  brain  inflammatory  responses,  reduce  microglial  phagocytic function, and elevate Aβ levels [49, 174].

Furthermore, in the setting of LPS-induced brain inflammation,  ABCA7  haplodeficiency  enhances  the  production of EPA during the acute inflammatory phase, thereby facilitating the resolution of acute inflammation [175].

## CLU

CLU, alternatively referred to as apolipoprotein J, demonstrates predominant expression within the central nervous system and holds a pivotal role in cholesterol and lipid  transport.  Genome-wide  association  studies  have established a significant association between CLU allelic variations  and  the  susceptibility  to  AD.  In  comparison to  control  counterparts,  AD  patients  manifest  notably increased  CLU  levels,  and  empirical  evidence  supports the direct interaction of CLU with Aβ, thereby facilitating the formation of Aβ fibrils [176].

Researchers  have  observed  that  the  deletion  of  the CLU gene alters the abundance and composition of the gut  microbiota,  characterized  by  an  increase  in Bacteroidetes and  a  decrease  in Firmicutes ,  indicating  a  close association between CLU and the gut microbiota [177]. Increased  TMAO  levels  induce  elevated  CLU  protein expression,  consequently  triggering  neuroinflammation and the production of β-secretase and βCTF in the hippocampus,  resulting  in  Aβ  deposition.  Conversely,  the inhibitor  3,3-Dimethyl-1-butanol  reduces  TMAO  levels,  inhibits  CLU  protein  expression,  and  improves hippocampal inflammation and cognition [130]. Treatment with Lactobacillus plantarum has been demonstrated to inhibit  the  production  of  gut  microbiota-derived  TMA and synthesis of TMAO, leading to reduced CLU expression, alleviation of cognitive impairment, and attenuation of neuropathology [178]. Currently, limited evidence supports the connection between CLU and the gut microbiota, necessitating further exploration of their relationship and the roles they play in the progression of AD. Considering the reduction of TMAO production via microbial modulation  may  offer  a  potential  avenue  for  mitigating CLU-mediated lipid homeostasis in AD.

## SREBP-1/2

Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) function as transcription factors, modulating the expression  of  genes  associated  with  lipid  synthesis.  There  are three  isoforms  of  SREBP  in  mammals:  SREBP1a,  contributing to overall lipid synthesis and growth; SREBP1c, associated  with  fatty  acid  synthesis  and  energy  storage; and  SREBP2,  playing  a  role  in  cholesterol  regulation [179,  180].  The  overexpression  of  SREBP-2  in  APP/PS1 mice  has  been  reported  to  exacerbate  amyloid  pathology  and  neuronal  death,  accompanied  by  a  decline  in cognitive abilities,  while  the  inhibition  of  SREBP-2  alleviates amyloid burden in AD mice [181, 182]. Additionally, another study validates that SCFAs can enhance the gene  expression  of  SREBP2,  consequently  facilitating hepatic absorption of serum cholesterol and augmenting the excretion of fecal bile acids [183]. In 3 × Tg-AD mice, elevated expression of SREBP1c results in increased cholesterol synthesis. Treatment with the probiotic SLAB51 reduces the protein expression of SREBP1c in the brain and liver, thereby improving the lipid profile and cognitive function [46].

## Molecular mechanisms of gut microbiota regulation of AD lipids and pathology

The mechanistic links between lipid metabolism dysregulation and AD include amyloid pathology, tau pathology, neuroinflammation,  oxidative  stress,  and  mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, the gut microbiota can directly or indirectly participate in the  pathological  mechanisms  of  AD  by  influencing  lipid  metabolism  (Fig.  2). This section focuses on presenting evidence for the role of  gut  microbiota  in  the  mechanisms  of  AD  lipids  and pathology.

## Amyloid pathology

The abnormal deposition of amyloid is a central pathological feature of AD [184]. Aβ, a peptide with a length of 36-43 amino acid residues, is generated through consecutive cleavages of APP by β-secretase (mainly BACE1) and γ-secretase [185, 186], with Aβ40 and Aβ42 being the most  common  in  AD.  The  activities  of  β-secretase  and γ-secretase are highly dependent on the lipid levels in the membrane,  emphasizing  the  close  connection  between Aβ pathology and lipids [186]. Certainly, the generation of  Aβ  takes  place  within  specialized  membrane  microdomains called lipid rafts, which are enriched with cholesterol,  phospholipids,  and  sphingolipids  [186,  187]. Increased  brain  cholesterol  levels  boost  the  activity  of β-secretases  and  γ-secretases  within  lipid  rafts,  suppress α-secretase activity, and stimulate the generation of harmful Aβ [185]. Aggregates of Aβ can directly engage with  cell  membrane  lipids  and  cholesterol,  disrupting membrane  integrity  and  permeability,  fostering  Ca 2 + influx, ultimately resulting in neuronal death [188].

Research  indicates  that  BAs  produced  by  gut  microbiota  increase  the  permeability  of  both  the  intestinal and  blood-brain  barriers  [189],  facilitating  the  entry  of peripheral  cholesterol  into  the  central  nervous  system. The  elevated  brain  cholesterol  directly  binds  with  APP, promoting the insertion of APP into the lipid raft phospholipid  layer  and  consequently  increasing  the  production of Aβ. Moreover, BAs downregulate the expression of  cholesterol-metabolizing  enzyme  CYP46A  through the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), promoting cholesterol accumulation and increasing Aβ production [190]. LPS,  similar  to  BAs,  have  been  shown  to  enhance  the expression  of  APP,  reduce  the  activity  of  α-secretase,

upregulate the activity of APP-cleaving enzyme BACE-1 and γ-secretase, promoting Aβ generation [115]. Furthermore,  the  gut  microbiota  metabolite  TMAO  has  been implicated in promoting Aβ accumulation in AD mice by increasing  the  activity  of  β-secretase  through  elevating CLU levels, leading to cognitive impairment [130].

## Tau pathology

Tau  pathology  is  initiated  by  the  aggregation  of  phosphorylated tau into oligomers, protofibrils, and filamentous NFTs, leading to synaptic damage and neurodegeneration  [191,  192].  Hence,  tau  pathology  is  also considered  a  major  driving  factor  in  the  neurodegenerative  changes  associated  with  AD  [1].  Evidence  suggest that cholesterol and lipoprotein particles impact the excessive  phosphorylation  of  tau  in  neurons  [193].  Further investigations reveal that CE induce tau phosphorylation  through  the  CE-proteasome-tau  axis.  Inhibiting cholesterol  synthesis  in  astrocytes  significantly  reduces the neuronal tau burden [67, 193]. These studies confirm that  disrupted  cholesterol  metabolism  influences  tau pathology of AD.

In a recent study, researchers subjected tau transgenic mice expressing different APOE isoforms to GF housing and antibiotic interventions. They found that modulation of  gut  microbiota  reduced  tau  pathology,  and  neurodegeneration  in  an  APOE  genotype-dependent  manner. Supplementation with SCFAs exacerbated tau pathology in GF-TE4 mice [100]. Additionally, increased abundance of the Bacteroides fragilis upregulates the PUFA metabolites  PGE1  and  12-HHTrE,  triggering  C/EBPβ/AEP  signaling  activation,  and  exacerbating  tau  pathology  [194]. Lactobacillus  plantarum DP189  increases  the  presence of Firmicutes and, through the modulation of the PI3K/ AKT/GSK3β  pathway,  decreases  the  levels  of  GSK3β, effectively  suppressing  tau  hyperphosphorylation  [195]. TUDCA inhibits the activation  of  AKT  and  suppresses GSK3β activity, reducing tau hyperphosphorylation and microglial activation, ultimately improving AD pathology [107].

## Neuroinflammation

Neuroinflammation  is  recognized  as  a  crucial  characteristic of brain tissue in AD patients, orchestrated predominantly  by  microglial  cells  and  astrocytes  [196].  In this  context,  misfolded  and  aggregated  proteins  bind  to pattern  recognition  receptors,  such  as  Toll-like  receptors  (TLRs),  located  on  the  surfaces  of  microglial  and astrocytic cells, initiating inflammatory responses. Acute inflammatory responses are believed to contribute to the clearance of Aβ, restoring tissue homeostasis. However, sustained inflammation induced by persistent Aβ stimulation  and  immune  activation  leads  to  the  continuous release  of  pro-inflammatory  factors  and  inflammatory mediators, increasing Aβ deposition and promoting the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, thereby exacerbating neuronal  and  synaptic  damage  and  contributing  to  the progression of AD [197]. Indeed, the critical role of neuroinflammation in AD has been reported as early as the year 2000 [198].

Current research has elucidated the impact of the gut microbiota  on  neuroinflammation  in  AD.  The  potential  connection  between  the  microbiota  and  AD  may involve  an  imbalance  in  gut  homeostasis,  characterized  by  an  increase  in  inflammatory  responses  and  a reduction in anti-inflammatory  microbes  [196,  199]. Microbiota analysis in AD patients reveals an increased abundance  of  pro-inflammatory  bacterial  groups  and a  decrease  in  butyrate-producing  taxa  such  as Butyrivibrio , Eubacterium , Clostridium sp . strain SY8519 , and Faecalibacterium  prausnitzii [200].  In  3 × Tg  mice, similar  phenomenon is observed, where beneficial antiinflammatory  bacterial  groups,  such  as Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria ,  gradually  decrease  with  age,  while  proinflammatory  taxa,  including Bacteroidetes and Ruminococcus ,  significantly  increase  [45].  Furthermore,  there is  a  close  association  between  gut  microbiota  and  their metabolites  with  the  activation  of  glial  cells  [201,  202]. Gut  microbiota  can  stimulate  glial  cells  to  participate in  the  neuroinflammatory  response  in  AD  [203,  204]. For  instance,  antibiotic  treatment  in  APP/PS1  mice  has been shown to reduce neuroglial reactivity, thereby alleviating Aβ plaque deposition [37, 205]. Acetate has been shown to upregulate the expression of GPR41 in microglial  cells,  inhibit  the  ERK/JNK/NF-κB  pathway,  reduce the  levels  of  COX2  and  IL-1β,  counteract  neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 mice, and improve cognitive abilities [94]. LPS, by activating the microglial cell surface TLR4 receptor, triggers downstream NF-κB transcription, leading to the activation of numerous pro-inflammatory factors such as TNFα, IL-6, and pro-IL-1β [114]. Indole acts through the AhR-NF-κB pathway, decreasing the expression  of  NLRP3  inflammasomes,  reducing  the  release  of inflammatory  cytokines  TNF-α,  IL-6,  IL-1β,  and  IL-18, alleviating  inflammation,  and  improving  cognitive  and behavioral abilities in APP/PS1 mice [138].

The  gut  microbiota  may  influence  neuroinflammatory  responses  in  AD  by  affecting  lipid  metabolism.  In brief,  activation  of  the  C/EBPβ/AEP  signaling  pathway by the gut microbiota in the brains of 3 × Tg mice upregulates  mRNA  transcription  for  inflammatory  enzymes related to AA [206], resulting in increased release of AA metabolites  such  as  prostaglandin  E2  (PGE2),  thromboxane B2, LKB4, and 12-HHT. This activation triggers microglial cell activation and intensifies neuroinflammation,  ultimately  worsening  cognitive  impairment.  Further  investigations  revealed  that  specific  gut  bacteria, including Bacteroides  intestinalis , Bacteroides  fragilis ,

and Bacteroides  xylanisolvens ,  produce  AA  metabolites and  contribute  to  AD  neuroinflammatory  responses. Conversely, a decrease in the abundance of anti-inflammatory SCFAs, due to reduced levels of Butyrivibrio and Eubacterium ,  exacerbates  chronic  neuroinflammation, elevates  APP and tau expression levels, and contributes to  AD  pathogenesis  [45].  In  a  recent  study,  the  authors identified  that Bacteroides  fragilis and  its  metabolites, 12-hydroxy-17-carbon-triene acid and PGE2, mediate PUFA metabolism in the gut microbiota of AD. This activation  leads  to  microglial  cell  induction  of  AD-like pathology  and  cognitive  impairments  [194],  providing compelling evidence for the role of gut microbiota in regulating AD lipid metabolism and neuroinflammation.

## Oxidative stress

Oxidative stress refers to the imbalance in cellular redox equilibrium caused by the accumulation of reactive oxygen  species  (ROS)  and  reactive  nitrogen  species  (RNS). ROS play a vital role in normal physiological conditions by  participating  in  signaling  pathways  and  transcriptional activation. Nevertheless, continuous accumulation of  ROS, coupled with compromised cellular antioxidant capacity, can result in the assault on cellular macromolecules  such  as  lipids,  proteins,  and  DNA.  This  process leads to lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and nucleic acid damage [207, 208]. Concurrently, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction disturb redox balance, fostering the generation and release of ROS [209]. The elevation of ROS and oxidative stress is recognized as one of the hallmarks of AD.

The central event of oxidative stress is lipid peroxidation, and the brain, rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, is susceptible  to  oxidative  stress  due  to  lipid  peroxidation [210]. SCFAs play a crucial role in regulating lipid peroxidation. For example, butyrate enhances fatty acid oxidation,  electron transport chain, and oxidative stress gene expression,  while  propionate  interacts  with  fatty  acid receptors,  upregulating  lipoprotein  lipase  to  promote lipid synthesis [211, 212]. Acetate is involved in regulating cholesterol metabolism and adipogenesis [213]. Thus, existing  evidence  supports  the  role  of  gut  microbiota in  mediating  oxidative  stress  alterations  in  AD  [208]. Propionate  bind  to  the  free  fatty  acid  receptor  GPR41 in  brain  endothelial  cells,  inhibiting  the  expression  of LRP-1 through a  CD14-dependent  mechanism,  and protecting the blood-brain barrier from oxidative stress through NRF2 signaling [95]. Butyrate act as ligands for GPR109A,  and  by  activating  GPR109A,  they  block  the NF-κB signaling pathway [212], a crucial pathway in oxidative stress in AD [214, 215]. Additionally, cells uptake butyrate  through  the  sodium-coupled  monocarboxylate  transporter  1  (SMCT1),  leading  to  the  generation of  Sp1.  This  activation  of  Sp1  stimulates  NRF2,  thereby promoting  the  production  of  SOD1  and  suppressing NOX2, preventing the excessive accumulation of reactive ROS in neurons [216]. Indole derivative IPA, an effective scavenger of hydroxyl radicals, protects central neurons from  oxidative  damage  by  reducing  DNA  damage  and lipid peroxidation [212].

## Mitochondrial dysfunction

Various  pieces  of  evidence  indicate  that  mitochondrial dysfunction is an early event in the pathogenesis of AD, including  alterations  in  mitochondrial  structure,  respiratory  dysfunction,  reduced  ATP  generation,  impaired dynamics,  and  elevated  mitochondrial-associated  oxidative stress [192, 217, 218]. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to the release of cytochrome c, which activates Caspase-9-dependent  neuronal  apoptosis,  disrupting  Ca 2 + homeostasis and triggering neuronal death. The association  between  the  gut  microbiota  and  mitochondria  has been  extensively  documented  over  an  extended  period [219, 220]. Microbial metabolite N6-carboxymethyllysine (CML)  mediates  ROS  burst,  damaging  mitochondrial activity and ATP storage in microglial cells [221]. Butyrate  enhances  mitochondrial  biogenesis  in  astrocytes  by upregulating the expression of PGC-1A, contributing to improved  mitochondrial  function  and  enhanced  cognitive abilities in AD mice [222]. IPA and indole-3-propionamide (IPAM) exert neuroprotective effects by mitigating mitochondrial electron leakage and neutralizing hydroxyl radicals. Moreover, indole compounds, including IPA and IPAM, permeate the  mitochondrial  membrane,  binding to  the  rate-limiting  phosphorylation  site  on  respiratory chain complex I. This action serves as an energy metabolism stabilizer, leading to a reduction in ROS production and contributing to neuroprotection [137].

## Epigenetic regulation

Epigenetic regulation encompasses processes such as histone modification, DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA regulation, all of which have been  demonstrated  to  play  a  crucial  role  in  neurodegenerative  diseases  [92,  93].  It  is  well-established  that the  expression  levels  of  key  proteins  implicated  in  AD, including  APP,  BACE1,  PS1,  and  APOE,  are  subject  to epigenetic  regulation.  Therefore,  the  imbalance  in  epigenetic regulation may underlie the aberrant expression of genes associated with synaptic plasticity and memory in  AD  [223].  Histone  modification  is  a  common  form of  epigenetic  regulation  in  AD,  influencing  the  stability  of  nucleosomes,  chromatin-mediated  processes  to participate in the regulation of gene expression. Histone modification encompasses acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, among  others, with acetylation playing  a  crucial  role  in  AD  [224].  Research  has  revealed  a reduction  in  H4K12  histone  acetylation  levels  in  aged

mice,  leading  to  defects  in  the  expression  of  learning and  memory-related  genes  [225].  Histone  acetylation  is regulated  by  histone  acetyltransferases  (HATs)  and  histone deacetylases (HDACs). In AD mice and patients, the expression of HDAC2 increases with age [226]. HDAC2 overexpression  reduces  dendritic  spine  density,  impairs neural plasticity and memory function, and suppressing or downregulating HDAC expression effectively restores cognitive function in AD animals [227].

Butyrate is described as a HDAC inhibitor, improving memory  function  in  APP/PS1  mice  by  enhancing  hippocampal histone acetylation [96]. Acetate enhances histone H3K18 over-acetylation and epigenetic regulation of BDNFPII and PIV promoter regions, leading to increased expression of BDNF and improvement in cognition [97]. Furthermore, acetate supplementation, as demonstrated in  5 × FAD mice, enhances histone  acetylation,  restoring synaptic  plasticity  and  cognitive  function  in  an  ACSS2dependent  manner  [228].  Studies  have  reported  that the immature phenotype of microglia in GF mice arises from  epigenetic  markings  of  key  mitochondrial  genes by H3K4me3 and H3K9ac, accompanied by intracellular fatty acid and lipid depletion. Acetate, driving microglial maturation  and  metabolic  homeostasis,  can  rescue  the impaired microglial  function  in  GF  mice.  In  the  pathological context of AD, acetate exhibits inhibitory effects on  microglial  phagocytic  function,  leading  to  increased Aβ burden in 5 × FAD mice [99].

## Targeting gut microbiota and lipids for the treatment of AD

Given the evidence supporting the role of gut microbiota and lipid metabolism in the pathological progression of AD,  it  becomes  crucial  to  understand  how  modulating the levels of microbiota and metabolites to improve AD pathology.  Therefore,  this  section  summarizes  the  primary preventive and therapeutic interventions aimed at regulating gut microbiota and lipid metabolism (Fig. 3).

## Gut microbiota-based therapy Probiotics

Probiotics,  as  live  microbial  supplements,  have  been shown  to  effectively  improve  gut  microbiota  balance and  provide  therapeutic  benefits  for  patients  with  AD [229]. Studies have demonstrated the therapeutic effects of  SLAB51  on  AD,  it  improves  glucose  homeostasis, reduces tau phosphorylation  [230],  increases  SCFAs such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, while decreasing inflammation and Aβ deposition [231]. It activates a SIRT1-dependent  mechanism,  reducing  oxidative  stress in the brains of AD mice [232]. Another study found that SLAB51 inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis, lowers the ω-6/ ω-3 fatty acid ratio, improves neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, ultimately reducing Aβ and tau aggregation, and slowing down AD progression [46]. Candida rugosa lipase  (CRL)  has  been  reported  to  increase  the  abundance  of Acetatifactor and Clostridiales  vadin  BB60 in  the  gut,  enhancing  lipid  hydrolysis  and  maintaining unsaturated  fatty  acid  homeostasis,  leading  to  reduced neuroinflammation  and  cognitive  deficits  in  APP/PS1 mic [233]. Lactobacillus plantarum DP189 regulates gut microbiota dysbiosis and inhibits tau hyperphosphorylation, as reported [195]. Additionally, it suppresses TMA production and TMAO synthesis, thereby reducing CLU expression  and  alleviating  neuroinflammation  and  neuropathological defects in APP/PS1 mice [233]. The probiotic VSL#3 efficiently reduces serum prostaglandin and deoxycholic acid levels, ameliorating intestinal inflammation and permeability. Nonetheless, its influence on brain plaque  deposition,  cytokine  levels,  and  gliosis  appears to be relatively limited [234]. Synthesizing this evidence with findings from other studies implies that combining probiotics with exercise could represent a more promising therapeutic strategy for enhancing cognitive function [235, 236]. In summary, probiotics modulate gut microbiota  composition  and  lipid  metabolism  homeostasis, exerting positive effects on brain inflammation, oxidative stress,  Aβ  pathology,  and  tau  pathology.  Therefore,  by regulating  the  microbial  composition  through  probiotics,  new  preventive  and  therapeutic  options  for  AD  are proposed.

## Prebiotics

Prebiotics,  composed  of  nondigestible  oligosaccharides, human  milk  oligosaccharides,  and  soluble,  fermentable fibers,  serve  as  an  alternative  to  probiotic  supplements. They effectively enhance beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli , improving cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice through the gut-brain axis [237, 238].  The  neuroprotective  effects  of  prebiotics  make them a potential oral formulation for the prevention and treatment  of  AD  [239].  Fructooligosaccharides  (FOS) demonstrate  beneficial  effects  in  APP/PS1  mice  [190], and  prebiotic  mannan  oligosaccharide  (MOS)  reshapes the gut microbiota, maintains intestinal barrier integrity, increases SCFAs production, inhibits neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, effectively alleviating cognitive and behavioral  deficits  in  5 × FAD mice [240]. In conclusion, supplementing  prebiotics  to  modulate  microbial  composition and function holds promise for improving AD; however, further research is needed to explore the applicability of prebiotics in AD treatment.

## Fecal microbiota transplantation

Fecal  microbiota  transplantation  (FMT)  involves  transferring  a  sample  of  healthy  donor  fecal  microbiota  into the  gut  of  a  patient  or  diseased  animal  to  restore  gut microbial health and improve disease treatment. Studies

Fig. 3 Potential interventions in the gut microbiota to regulate lipid balance and mitigate pathological progression in Alzheimer's disease. Current evidence suggests that interventions such as gut microbiota-based therapies (probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation), pharmacological treatments (polyphenols, herbal remedies, statins), and lifestyle modifications (dietary patterns, exercise) can target the gut microbiome. These interventions promote gut microbiota and lipid homeostasis, ultimately enhancing cognitive function. These measures hold promise as potential strategies for preventing and treating the progression of Alzheimer's disease

have  shown  that  transplanting  fecal  microbiota  from wild-type  mice  to  ADLP APT mice  effectively  ameliorated Aβ plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, glial reactivity, and cognitive impairment, suggesting that restoring gut microbial homeostasis through FMT may have beneficial effects  on  AD  treatment [40].  Another study confirmed that  fecal  transplantation  from  WT  mice  increased  the abundance of Bacteroidetes ,  reduced Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia in  the  gut  of  APP/PS1  mice,  increased butyrate  levels,  and  significantly  improved  pathological features such as Aβ accumulation, synaptic dysfunction,  neuroinflammation,  and  cognitive  deficits  [241]. Intervention  with  FMT  from  WT  mice  modulate  glycerophospholipid  metabolism  in  APP/PS1  mice,  leading to  an  amelioration  of  Aβ  pathology  and  neuroinflammation  [43].  Conversely,  transplanting  gut  microbiota from AD mice impaired memory function and neurogenesis  in  wild-type  mice  [242,  243].  Although  the  specific functions of the gut microbiota in these contexts are not yet  fully  elucidated,  based  on  these  results,  healthy  gut microbiota  transplantation  appears  to  exhibit  a  positive  role  in  AD  pathology.  Table  1  summarizes  current research on the gut microbiota-based therapy in improving AD lipid metabolism and pathological features.

## Pharmaceutical formulation

## Polyphenols

Polyphenols, natural compounds found in fruits and vegetables, possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  they  improve  the pathological processes of AD by modulating microbiota homeostasis,  mitochondrial  function,  oxidative  stress, and  inflammatory  responses  [250].  Oral  administration of 200 mg/kg hawthorn flavonoid (HF) increased the proportion  of Dubosiella and Alloprevotella ,  reversing  gut

This led  to  elevated  levels  of  docosapentaenoic  acid  (DPA), sphingolipids,  and  PC,  significantly  ameliorating  cognitive  deficits,  Aβ  accumulation,  and  abnormal  activation of hippocampal astrocytes in AD mice [251]. Curcumin reduced  the  abundance  of Prevotellaceae , Bacteroides , and Escherichia/Shigella in  the  gut  of  APP/PS1  mice. In  BV2  microglial  cells,  it  upregulated  the  expression of  TREM2,  alleviating  neuroinflammation  and  amyloid plaque  burden,  thereby  enhancing  cognition  [252,  253]. Bilberry  anthocyanins  (BA)  lowered  serum  and  brain LPS levels, increased SCFAs in feces, induced microglial phagocytosis of Aβ through the CD33/TREM2/TYROBP signaling  pathway,  alleviated  hippocampal  neuroinflammation, and reversed cognitive impairments in APP/PS1 mice [254]. In conclusion, the interaction of polyphenols with the gut-brain axis enables them to influence the central  nervous  system  and  exert  neuroprotective  activity. Further development of their therapeutic potential in AD is warranted.

## Herbal medicines

Herbal medicines (HMs), also known as botanical medicines or phytomedicines, refer to plant-derived materials or preparations with therapeutic or other human health benefits.  Studies  have  reported  that  the  chemical  substances  in  herbal  medicines  can  be  transformed  by  gut microbiota into metabolites, thereby improving the composition, functional impairments, and associated pathological  progress  of  the  gut  microbiota.  The  regulatory effects  of  herbal  medicines  on  the  gut  microbiota  have also  been  applied  in  AD  [255].  Patchouli  alcohol  (PA) has been demonstrated to effectively inhibit pro-inflammatory microbial groups such as Bacteroides , Klebsiella , Bilophila, Proteobacteria , and Enterobacteriaceae . It enhances the abundance of anti-inflammatory microbial groups, such as Firmicutes and Lactobacillus , suppresses the activation of the C/EBPβ/AEP pathway, alleviates Aβ plaque  deposition,  tau  hyperphosphorylation,  and  neuroinflammation,  ultimately  improving  cognitive  deficits in  TgCRND8  mice  [256].  Schisandra  chinensis  (S.  chinensis)  improves  learning  and  memory  abilities  in  AD rats by increasing SCFAs levels and alleviating neuroinflammation  [257].  Alpinae  Oxyphyllae  Fructus  (AOF) has been proven to regulate TREM2 and mitigate LPSinduced neuroinflammation, promoting a beneficial M2 phenotype in microglial cells and ameliorating cognitive impairments  in  mice  [258,  259].  Epimedii  Folium  and Curculiginis Rhizoma, extracts of Horny Goat Weed and Xianmao, enhance TREM2 protein expression in the hippocampus by reducing TNF-α and IL-1β, regulating the transformation  and  activation  of  microglial  cells,  thus improving LPS-induced cognitive impairments [260]. In addition,  Pyrolae  herba  (PH)  regulates  TREM2  expression, inhibits LPS-induced neuroinflammation, and alleviates  cognitive  impairments  [261].  The  therapeutic effects  of  herbal  medicine  on  AD  are  highly  complex, involving multiple aspects, with gut microbiota and lipid metabolism being just one facet. The precise therapeutic mechanisms remain to be elucidated.

## Statins

Statins  inhibit  HMG  CoA  reductase  in  the  cholesterol biosynthetic  pathway,  affecting  intracellular  cholesterol distribution,  gene  expression,  and  proteasome  activity. This leads to a reduction in Aβ production, lowering the risk of AD and demonstrating positive effects on cognitive  function.  Beyond  their  well-known  lipid-lowering effects,  statins  may  also  influence  AD  cognitive  function  through  mechanisms involving the gut microbiota. For instance,  atorvastatin  has  been  shown  to  effectively increase the abundance of intestinal Lactobacillus while reducing Blautia and Ruminococcaceae . This modulation of  the  gut-brain  axis  alleviates  neuroinflammation  and improves  cognition.  Both  atorvastatin  and  rosuvastatin increase  the  abundance  of  butyrate-producing  bacteria, such  as Butyricimonas , Bacteroides ,  and Mucispirillum , leading to reduced IL-1β levels and improved inflammation  [262].  Oral  administration  of  simvastatin  has  been demonstrated to enhance gut microbial activity, increase

SCFAs levels in feces, strengthen intestinal cell connections,  and  reduce  cell  death  and  amyloid  plaque  deposition  in  the  hippocampal  tissue  [263].  As  showed  in Table 2. Furthermore, the effects and influences of statins on AD are still under ongoing exploration, with the interaction with gut microbiota being a potential mechanism.

## Lifestyle

## Dietary patterns

Dietary  patterns  have  been  shown  to  play  a  role  in  AD pathology. The  Western  diet, characterized by high fat,  high  protein,  and  low  fiber  intake,  has  been  associated  with  a  reduced  abundance  of  beneficial  microbial  strains,  including Lactobacillus , Ruminococcaceae , Lachnospiraceae , and SCFA-producing  bacteria such as Ruminococcus  bromii , Faecalibacterium  prausnitzii, Eubacterium  rectale , Eubacterium  hallii ,  and Anaerostipes coli SS2/1 , correlating with an increased risk of AD [266]. In contrast, the Mediterranean diet (MeDi), representing a balanced nutritional pattern rich in unsaturated fatty  acids,  vegetables,  fruits,  and  lean  meat  proteins, has demonstrated the ability to effectively modulate the abundance  of  beneficial  bacteria,  including Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus ,  in the gut, thereby reducing the risk  of  AD  onset  [267].  The  ketogenic  diet  emphasizes very low carbohydrate intake and high-fat foods, exhibiting therapeutic effects in AD patients by modulating gut homeostasis, reducing neuronal overexcitation, enhancing mitochondrial metabolism, and decreasing oxidative stress [268]. In a randomized, double-blind, single-center

clinical  study,  the  Modified  Mediterranean-Ketogenic Diet (MMKD), which allows increased carbohydrate consumption compared to the ketogenic diet, involves higher intake  of  vegetables,  fruits,  olive  oil,  as  well  as  fats  and proteins from fish sources. The results demonstrated that MMKD increased the abundance of the Phylum Tenericutes and the family Enterobacteriaceae ,  both negatively correlated with the expression levels of Aβ42 in the cerebrospinal  fluid.  This  dietary  approach  also  increased butyrate  levels,  restricted  LPS  diffusion,  promoted  gut barrier stability, effectively restored gut microbiota composition,  enhanced  steroid  biosynthesis,  and  improved AD  pathology  [267].  Therefore,  the  modulation  of  gut microbiota  and  lipid  metabolism  by  dietary  patterns holds significant importance in the prevention of AD and the attenuation of disease progression.

## Exercise

Exercise  can  stimulate  the  proliferation  of  'beneficial' microbial communities, maintaining gut microbiota balance  and  subsequently  improving  health  conditions [269].  Consequently, exercise is regarded as an effective and  readily  available  therapeutic  approach,  possibly  the single most important and accessible lifestyle component offering protection against a broad range of diseases [270, 271].  There  is  a  close  association  between  exercise  and the gut-brain axis. Studies have found a negative correlation  between physical activity  and  the  risk  of  AD,  indicating that regular exercise in the elderly can prevent AD and slow cognitive decline. Therefore, exercise serves as both a preventive strategy and an intervention measure in the treatment of AD [272, 273].

A  16-week  running  wheel  exercise  regimen  has  been demonstrated  to  increase  the  abundance  of Firmicutes while  decreasing  the  abundance  of Bacteroidetes and Tenericutes ,  effectively  improving  gut  microbiota  composition  and  memory  [274].  Running  exercise  has  also been shown to increase the microbial content of Eubacteria , Roseburia ,  and Clostridia in the intestines of APP/PS1 mice, while decreasing the abundance of Prevotella , Bacteroides , Bacteroides fragilis , and L. johnsonii . This alteration inhibits the transfer of LPS to the brain, thereby alleviating LPS-induced neuroinflammation and improving  cognitive  function  and  pathological  markers  in  AD  mice  [273,  275].  Moreover,  voluntary  wheel running  (VWR)  exercise  has  been  found  to  upregulate the  abundance  of  phylum Bacteroidetes and  genus Prevotella while  reducing  the  abundance  of  phylum Actinobacteria and TM7 ,  as  well  as  genus Oscillospira and Ruminococcus .  This modulation mitigates cognitive dysfunction induced by TMAO [276]. These studies collectively indicate that exercise serves as an effective measure in  regulating  gut  microbiota  to  improve  the  pathological  progression  of  AD,  presenting  substantial  potential in  both  the  treatment  and  prevention  of  AD.  However, it  is  imperative  to  recognize  that  as  an  intervention  for AD, further research is needed to explore the specifics of exercise protocols, modes, and intensities.

## Conclusions and perspectives

As  emphasized  in  this  review,  the  intricate  interplay between  gut  microbiota  and  lipid  metabolism  in  the pathogenesis  of  AD  is  a  noteworthy  research  area.  We summarize  the  current  research  evidence,  highlighting  the  central  role  of  gut  microbiota-derived  metabolites  such  as  SCFAs,  LPS,  TMAO, BAs, and tryptophan indole  derivatives  in  the  lipid  metabolism  disruption  of AD  pathology.  As  the  ultimate  products  of  gut  microbiota,  microbial  metabolites  not  only  interact  with  key lipid metabolism genes such as APOE, TREM2, ABCA1, ABCA7, SREBP1, SREBP2, and CLU but also participate in  AD  lipid  metabolism  and  pathological  processes  by regulating  Aβ  and  tau  pathologies,  neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and epigenetic regulation. These mechanisms are interconnected and mutually influential, and while we have only begun to elucidate their complex pathological associations, the exact underlying mechanisms warrant further in-depth exploration. In future research, the application of omics techniques such as metagenomics, meta transcriptomics, and metabolomics will aid in uncovering the intricate mechanisms  governing  the  relationship  between  lipids,  gut microbiota,  and  AD,  providing  a  deeper  understanding of their interconnections. Moreover, current therapeutic strategies and drugs for AD remain limited, and the close connection between gut microbiota and lipid metabolism provides  new  insights  into  treatment  approaches.  Supplementation  with  potential  beneficial  bacteria  through probiotics,  prebiotics,  and  fecal  microbiota  transplantation may impede or slow the pathological progression of AD. Additionally, the direct impact of diet on the production of microbial metabolites should not be overlooked, emphasizing the importance of dietary regulation. Exercise, as a beneficial lifestyle factor, also holds importance in  the  prevention  of  Alzheimer's  disease.  Polyphenols, herbal  medicines,  and  statin  drugs  demonstrate  neuroprotective effects in the gut microbiota and lipid metabolism of AD, potentially holding translational value.
