## Abstract

Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is an innate immune receptor predominantly expressed by microglia in the brain. Recent studies have established TREM2 as a central immune signaling hub in neurodegeneration, where it triggers immune responses upon sensing pathological development and tissue damages. TREM2 binds diverse ligands and activates downstream pathways that regulate microglial phagocytosis, inflammatory responses, and metabolic reprogramming. Interestingly, TREM2 exists both in its membrane-bound form and as a soluble variant (sTREM2), that latter is generated through proteolytic shedding or alternative splicing and can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma. Emerging clinical and preclinical evidence underscores the potential of TREM2 and sTREM2 as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the molecular functions, regulatory mechanisms, and pathological implications of TREM2 and sTREM2 in AD. Furthermore, we explore their potential roles in diagnostics and therapeutics while suggesting key research directions for advancing TREM2/sTREM2-based strategies in combating AD.

## Background

Alzheimer's  disease  (AD)  is  a  devastating  neurodegenerative disorder marked by progressive cognitive decline and  key  neuropathological  features,  such  as  amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and chronic neuroinflammation [1-3]. While significant strides have been made  in  understanding  these  pathological  markers,  the role of microglia-the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS)-has gained increasing attention over the past decade. Microglia play a crucial role in maintaining  brain  homeostasis;  however,  they  become dysregulated in AD, contributing to disease progression through  maladaptive  neuroinflammatory  responses  and impaired clearance of neurotoxic materials [4, 5]. A key player  in  microglial  functions  is  the  triggering  receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), a transmembrane  receptor  that  has  been  strongly  associated  with the risk for AD [6, 7]. TREM2 has emerged as a critical

modulator in shaping microglial responses to AD, making it a compelling therapeutic target for mitigating ADassociated pathology [8-10].

TREM2  signaling  is  mediated  through  its  interaction  with  adaptor  proteins  DNAX-activating  protein  12 (DAP12) and DAP10, which contain essential motifs for signal  transduction  [11].  Binding  of  ligands-including lipids,  lipoproteins,  apolipoproteins,  or  Aβ-to  TREM2 triggers intracellular signaling cascades  that regulate microglial responses to AD pathology [10, 12]. Notably, genetic  variants  of  TREM2,  especially  the  R47H  mutation,  are  strongly  associated  with  increased  AD  risk  [6, 7]. These mutations impair TREM2 functions, leading to reduced microglial activation, dysregulated inflammatory responses, impaired metabolic functions, and inadequate clearance of Aβ. Collectively, these factors exacerbate AD pathology, emphasizing TREM2's central role in both AD susceptibility and progression, and reinforcing its potential as a therapeutic target to enhance microglial protective function and combat disease mechanisms [13].

Beyond  its  role  as  a  cell-surface  receptor,  TREM2 undergoes proteolytic cleavage or alternative splicing,  resulting  in  the  release  of  its  soluble  ectodomain (sTREM2)  into  the  extracellular  space,  where  it  can  be detected  in  cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF)  and  plasma  [1417].  As  both  a  biomarker  and  a  potential  modulator  in AD,  sTREM2  has  been  associated  with  microglial  activation and disease progression, as evidenced by findings from  human  studies  and  AD  mouse  models.  Elevated CSF sTREM2 levels correlate  with  early  AD  stages  and neuroinflammatory responses, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker [18, 19]. Furthermore, preclinical and clinical studies indicate that sTREM2 may exert neuroprotective effects by mitigating Aβ and tau pathologies, potentially slowing cognitive decline and disease progression [20-23].

Despite these advances, many questions remain unanswered  regarding  the  precise  mechanisms  by  which TREM2 and sTREM2 influence microglial functions and AD pathogenesis.  Understanding  the  interplay  between genetic variations, TREM2  signaling,  and  sTREM2mediated effects could provide valuable insights into AD pathogenesis and guide the development of targeted therapies. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge on TREM2 and sTREM2 in AD, focusing on their molecular  functions,  pathological  implications,  and  therapeutic potential. By consolidating recent findings, we seek to highlight critical gaps in our understanding and propose future  directions  for  advancing  TREM2/sTREM2-based strategies in AD diagnostics and therapeutics.

## TREM2 as a cell-surface receptor

## TREM2 genetic variants and signaling

Genetic  variations  in  TREM2  have  been  implicated  in several neurodegenerative disorders, including AD, frontotemporal  dementia  (FTD),  and  Nasu-Hakola  disease (NHD), with over 70 variants identified to date [9]. Homozygous  TREM2  mutations,  including  early  stop codons (E14X, Q33X, W44X, W78X) [24-27] and missense mutations in the immunoglobulin-like ectodomain (Y38C, W50C, T66M, V126G) [24, 28, 29], are primarily linked to NHD, a rare disorder characterized by earlyonset dementia, demyelination, and bone cysts. Notably, some  patients  carrying  specific  homozygous  TREM2 mutations,  such  as  Q33X,  Y38C,  and  T66M,  exhibit  an FTD-like  syndrome  with  behavioral  changes,  cognitive decline,  and  motor  impairments  [24].  Unlike  classical NHD, these FTD patients do not develop bone cysts or other  obvious  skeletal  abnormalities.  This  phenotypic variability  suggests  that  the  clinical  manifestations  of these mutations may also be influenced by genetic background or environmental factors.

The  most  well-established  TREM2  variant  associated with AD is the R47H substitution (rs75932628) [6, 7, 30]. Early studies in European and North American cohorts identified  a  strong  association  between  heterozygous R47H carriers and AD, reporting odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 2.83 to 4.59-comparable to the risk conferred by  the  APOE  ε4  allele  [6,  7].  These  findings  have  been consistently  validated  by  subsequent  meta-analyses  and replication  studies  [31-36].  Notably,  individuals  homozygous for the R47H variant face an even greater risk of developing AD compared to heterozygous carriers [30]. Interestingly,  cognitive  decline  has  been  observed  in R47H carriers between the ages of 80 and 100, even in the absence of an AD diagnosis [7]. However, the association between R47H and AD appears weaker in non-European populations,  including  African-American  [37],  Chinese [38-41],  and  Japanese  [42]  cohorts.  Furthermore,  while R47H  has  been  linked  to  an  increased  risk  of  FTD  in North  American  populations  [43],  no  such  association has been observed in European cohorts [36], highlighting the geographic and genetic heterogeneity in its effects.

Other  AD-associated  TREM2  variants  also  exhibit population-specific associations. For instance, the R62H variant  (rs143332484)  serves  as  a  significant  AD  risk modifier in Caucasian populations [34, 35], but it is not associated with AD risk in African-Americans, likely due to its low frequency in this population [37]. The H157Y variant  (rs2234255),  identified  in  Han  Chinese  populations,  is  linked  to  late-onset  AD  [44],  with  subsequent studies  supporting  the  association  in  the  Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ORs: 4.7) [45], while a large Caucasian case-control study found no significant correlation [35]. These findings highlight the intricate role of

TREM2  genetic  variations  in  neurodegeneration,  with their effects influenced by mutation type, genetic ancestry,  and  disease  stage  or  pathological  environment.  The three-dimensional  structure  of  TREM2,  elucidated  by X-ray  crystallography,  offers  further  insights  into  the functional consequences of these genetic variants. NHDassociated mutations are predominantly localized to buried  regions  of  the  protein,  potentially  destabilizing  its structure [46]. In contrast, AD-associated variants reside on  the  protein's  surface,  impairing  ligand  binding  and receptor activation. For example, the R47H substitution reduces TREM2's affinity for key ligands, including phospholipids and Aβ, leading to diminished downstream signaling [47-49].

TREM2 signaling is mediated by the adaptor proteins DAP12  and  DAP10,  as  TREM2  itself  lacks  an  intrinsic signaling domain [50, 51] (Fig. 1). Ligand binding to the extracellular domain of TREM2 initiates downstream signaling cascade. TREM2 ligands include Aβ and a diverse array of lipids, such as phospholipids and sphingolipids. Additionally, TREM2  interacts with apolipoproteins, including apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and apolipoprotein J (ApoJ),  as  well  as  lipoproteins  like  low-density  lipoprotein  (LDL)  and  high-density  lipoprotein  (HDL)  [47-49, 52-55]. Upon ligand binding to TREM2, the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in DAP12 is phosphorylated by Src family kinases, creating a docking  site  for  spleen  tyrosine  kinase  (SYK).  SYK  is  then recruited and activated, initiating downstream signaling [10]. Concurrently, DAP10, through its cytosolic YXNM motif,  directly  recruits  the  PI3K  subunit  to  activate  the PI3K  pathway,  thereby  amplifying  the  cellular  response to TREM2 activation [10]. SYK and PI3K activation subsequently  trigger  multiple  downstream  pathways  that regulate diverse cellular processes (Fig. 1). Key signaling cascades  downstream  of  SYK  include  phospholipase  C gamma 2 (PLCγ2), Rac1/Cdc42, ERK and PI3K [51, 56, 57]. These pathways regulate distinct yet interconnected microglial  functions.  Specifically,  PLCγ2  activation  is critical for microglial phagocytosis and lipid metabolism [56].  Meanwhile,  Rac1/Cdc42-GTPase  signaling  plays a  key  role  in  cytoskeletal  remodeling  and  cell  migration [57]. Additionally, the ERK pathway is essential for microglial survival, proliferation, and inflammatory responses  [51].  In  parallel,  the  PI3K/Akt  pathway,  activated by both DAP10 and SYK, governs essential cellular processes such as survival, proliferation, and glucose metabolism  [11,  58-60].  Collectively,  these  pathways coordinate  microglial  responses  to  environmental  cues, highlighting  the  central  role  of  TREM2  signaling  in microglial functions.

Beyond its role in TREM2 signaling, DAP12 itself has emerged  as  a  key  regulator  of  microglial  functions  in AD  [61].  Genetic  studies  have  identified  heterozygous loss-of-function  variants  in  TYROBP,  the  gene  encoding  DAP12, which are strongly associated with AD risk [30]. This underscores the importance of intact DAP12dependent  pathways  in  disease  modulation.  While  the precise  functional  consequences  of  altered  DAP12  signaling remain an area of active investigation, it is evident that  defects  in  this  adaptor  protein  profoundly  impact microglial responses to pathological insults.

The TREM2-DAP12 signaling pathway is dynamically regulated.   As demonstrated in osteoclasts, phosphorylation  of  DAP12  following  receptor  cross-linking  recruits SH2-containing  inositol  polyphosphate  phosphatase  1 (SHIP1),  which  antagonizes  SYK  activation  and  dampens  downstream  signaling  [51].    While  this  mechanism has not been directly validated in microglia, the conservation  of  DAP12-SHIP1-SYK  signaling  modules  across myeloid lineages suggests potential functional relevance. This recruitment serves as a negative regulatory mechanism, fine-tuning TREM2-dependent activation.   A ligand avidity-dependent  model  extrapolated  from  these  findings proposes that low-avidity ligands preferentially drive SHIP1 recruitment to suppress signaling, whereas highavidity  ligands  that  induce  TREM2  cross-linking  promote robust SYK-dependent activation.   This hypothesis could explain why heterozygous TREM2 variants impairing ligand binding mimic low-affinity ligand effects, shifting the balance toward inhibition.

In conclusion, TREM2 orchestrates multiple microglial functions,  including  cell  survival,  proliferation,  migration,  phagocytosis  and  metabolism,  through  a  complex intracellular signaling network. Understanding how genetic  variants  affect  TREM2  structure  and  function is  critical  for  elucidating  the  mechanisms  underlying neurodegenerative  diseases  and  may  provide  valuable insights for potential therapeutic strategies.

## TREM2 and glucose metabolism

AD is characterized by regional brain hypometabolism, a hallmark dysfunction measurable using 2-Deoxy-2-[18 F] fluoro-D-glucose  positron  emission  tomography  (FDGPET)  [62].  Large-scale  proteomic  analyses  of  brain  and CSF samples from AD patients reveal significant alterations  in  glucose  metabolism,  which  correlate  with  both AD pathology and cognitive decline [63]. Key glycolytic genes,  such  as  pyruvate  kinase  muscle  isoform  (PKM) and lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB), are upregulated in AD, highlighting the central role of glucose metabolism in  disease  progression  [64].  Among  various  cell  types, microglia play a particularly important role in AD-related metabolic changes [63].

Acute  exposure  to  Aβ  induces  metabolic  reprogramming  in microglia, shifting  energy  production  from oxidative  phosphorylation  to  glycolysis  [65].  This  shift is critical for initiating  inflammatory  responses  and

Fig. 1 Schematic illustration of TREM2 signaling. The membrane-bound TREM2 receptor interacts with various ligands, including lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins and amyloid-β. Ligand binding to TREM2 triggers the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the ITAM motif of the DAP12 cytoplasmic domain by SRC family kinases. The phosphorylated ITAM recruit the protein tyrosine kinase SYK to activate downstream signaling pathways. Additionally, TREM2 can associate with DAP10 homodimer, which contains YXNM motifs. These motifs directly recruit PI3K, activating further signaling pathways. SYK activation drives key pathways, including PLCγ2, Rac1/Cdc42, ERK, and PI3K. PLCγ2 activation is critical for microglial phagocytosis and lipid metabolism. Meanwhile, Rac1/Cdc42-GTPase signaling plays a key role in cytoskeletal remodeling and cell migration. Additionally, the ERK pathway is essential for microglial survival, proliferation, and inflammatory responses. In parallel, the PI3K/Akt pathway, activated by both DAP10 and SYK, governs essential cellular processes such as survival, proliferation, and glucose metabolism.

involves increased glucose uptake, enhanced lactate production, and upregulation of glycolytic enzymes [64, 66]. Interestingly,  lactate  production  further  amplifies  glycolysis  through  histone  lactylation,  which  upregulates glycolytic  gene  expression  in  a  positive  feedback  loop [64].  Disrupting  this  feedback  loop  has  been  shown  to restore  microglial  protective  functions,  although  how

Aβ  induces  metabolic  pathway  alterations  in  microglia remains incompletely understood.

The metabolic fitness of microglia is markedly impaired in TREM2 knockout (KO) models [58]. TREM2, through its adaptors DAP12 and DAP10, activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which plays  a  crucial  role  in  regulating  metabolic  pathways and  protein  synthesis  [11,  58].  Loss  of  TREM2  impairs

mTOR  activation,  leading  to  reduced  ATP  production and biosynthesis. In vivo FDG-PET imaging of TREM2 KO and TREM2 T66M knock-in mice shows a significant reduction  in  cerebral  glucose  metabolism  [67,  68].  This decrease may correlate with impaired glucose uptake by microglia. Supporting this, ex vivo measurements of isolated  microglia  from  TREM2  KO  animals  reveal  lower FDG uptake [68].

Given  the  pivotal  role  of  microglial  metabolism  in AD, targeting this process represents a promising therapeutic strategy. Agents such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and cyclocreatine,  which  enhance  ATP  production,  have been shown to restore microglial functions and mitigate AD pathology [58, 65]. Notably, TREM2-activating antibodies  boost  microglial  energy  metabolism  by  promoting mitochondrial fatty acid and glucose oxidation [69]. Moreover,  translocator  protein  (TSPO)-PET  and  FDGPET imaging have demonstrated that TREM2 activation enhances  microglial  activity  and  glucose  metabolism in  amyloid  mouse  models.  Thus,  targeting  TREM2  and microglial  metabolism  may  complement  existing  AD therapies,  which  primarily  focus  on  amyloid  clearance and synaptic dysfunction, providing a more comprehensive approach to disease intervention.

## TREM2 and lipid metabolism

Lipid  metabolism  is  crucial  for  maintaining  microglial functions  and  CNS  homeostasis,  influencing  cellular membrane  integrity,  energy  storage,  and  inflammatory responses. Emerging evidence identifies TREM2 as a key regulator of lipid metabolism in the brain. TREM2 binds a  diverse  range  of  lipids,  including  anionic  and  zwitterionic  species  such  as  sphingomyelin,  phosphatidic  acid, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine  (PtdSer) and  sulfatide [49, 53, 70]. Among these, PtdSer is the most abundant negatively  charged  phospholipid  in  the  inner  leaflet  of the plasma membrane in eukaryotic cells [71]. In neurodegenerative conditions, PtdSer externalization on damaged or apoptotic neurons serves as an 'eat-me' signal, triggering  TREM2-dependent  microglial  synaptic  pruning and cell clearance [72]. Super-resolution microscopy and in vivo imaging studies have demonstrated that Aβ oligomer-induced  hyperactive  synapses  expose  PtdSer, marking them for TREM2-mediated engulfment, which helps  mitigate  neuronal  hyperactivity  in  AD  models. Additionally,  individuals  carrying  TREM2  loss-of-function  variants  exhibit  an  accumulation  of  apoptotic-like synapses  [72],  underscoring  TREM2's  essential  role  in synaptic homeostasis during early AD pathology. Beyond synaptic pruning, TREM2 facilitates the recognition and clearance  of  damaged  cells.  Notably,  over-expression  of TREM2 in non-phagocytic cells, such as Chinese hamster  ovary  (CHO)  and  HEK293  cells,  enables  them  to engulf  apoptotic  neurons,  highlighting  TREM2's  function in lipid sensing and phagocytosis [16, 73]. This broad lipid-binding  capability  underscores  TREM2's  critical role in modulating microglial responses to neurodegenerative insults and preserving neuronal health.

TREM2  also  regulates  microglial  responses  during demyelination,  as  observed  in  aging,  cuprizone  treatment,  and  lysolecithin  injection  models.  In  wild-type (WT) animals, microglial clusters, termed nodules, form in  the  white  matter  and  increase  with  age  [74].  These nodules are involved in clearing degenerated myelin, and their  formation  depends  on  TREM2,  as  fewer  clusters are  observed in TREM2 KO or loss-of-function mutant animals  [67,  74].  In  aged  TREM2-deficient  animals, myelin debris accumulation correlates with reduced myelin  integrity,  increased  axonal  damage,  and  fewer mature  oligodendrocytes  in  the  striatum,  underscoring TREM2's protective role in aging [75]. In the cuprizone model  of  toxic  demyelination,  TREM2's  involvement  in microglial  activation  is  further  confirmed.  After  cuprizone  treatment,  microglia  exhibit  an  amoeboid-activated  morphology  [76].  However,  in  TREM2  KO  mice, microglia  maintain  a  more  ramified  morphology  with less  microgliosis.  At  the  transcriptomic  level,  microglia from  TREM2-deficient  animals  fail  to  upregulate  genes related to activation, phagocytosis, and lipid metabolism, impairing  lysosomal  and  phagosomal  function,  disrupting  oxidative  phosphorylation,  and  altering  cholesterol metabolism  [76-78].  This  failure  to  clear  myelin  debris leads  to  impaired  axonal  transport,  axonal  dystrophies, and  worsened  locomotor  deficits  in  TREM2  KO  mice compared  to  WT  controls.  Similarly,  in  the  lysolecithin-induced demyelination model, TREM2-deficient mice show a marked accumulation of myelin debris and impaired lesion recovery. This is evidenced by a significant reduction in the number of remyelinated axons, as observed  via  transmission  electron  microscopy  3  to  8 weeks post-injection [79, 80]. These findings suggest that TREM2 deficiency impairs myelin clearance, likely due to defects in phagocytosis, reduced lysosomal degradation, or a combination of both.

Another key aspect of TREM2 function is its regulation of  lipid  droplet  formation.  In  the  lysolecithin  injection model, TREM2 deficiency led to a significant reduction in  lipid  droplets  within  microglia  and  macrophages  at lesion  sites,  as  indicated  by  immunostaining  for  perilipin 2, a key structural component of lipid droplets [79]. The impaired biogenesis of lipid droplets and cholesterol esterification  in  TREM2-deficient  microglia  was  associated  with  elevated  endoplasmic  reticulum  stress,  ultimately hindering the remyelination process. In contrast, in  the  cuprizone  model,  TREM2  deficiency  resulted  in excessive  accumulation  of  cholesteryl  ester  in  microglia  [77].  This  accumulation  is  associated  with  elevated

plasma neurofilament light chain (Nf-L) levels, a marker of  axonal  damage,  indicating  a  link  between  TREM2 deficiency, lipid dysregulation, and neuronal injury. Further  supporting  this  connection,  human  induced  pluripotent stem  cell (iPSC)-derived  microglia-like  cells (iMGLs)  with  TREM2  KO  exhibit  lipid  accumulation following  myelin  treatment,  as  demonstrated  by  Nile Red  staining  [56].  This  accumulation  is  dependent  on downstream PLCγ2 activity. These findings highlight the critical  role  of  TREM2  in  lipid  metabolism.  The  variations in lipid droplet accumulation observed across different models may stem from differences in experimental design-such  as  the  method  of  demyelination  (local demyelination  induced  by  lysolecithin  injection  versus global  demyelination  triggered  by  cuprizone  feeding), the time points analyzed (e.g., a 0.2% cuprizone diet for 5  or  12  weeks  during  demyelination  versus  21  and  62 days post-lysolecithin injection during remyelination versus iMGLs exposed to myelin debris for 48 h), or the lipid visualization techniques employed (perilipin 2 staining  versus  Nile  Red  staining).  Despite  these  discrepancies,  these  studies  collectively  reinforce  the  protective role of TREM2 in remyelination and neuronal function. However,  the  precise  molecular  mechanisms  by  which TREM2 regulates lipid metabolism and the downstream events leading to altered lipid levels in its absence are not fully  understood.  Addressing  these  gaps  through  future research will be essential for unraveling the complex relationship  between  TREM2  signaling,  lipid  metabolism, and neurodegeneration.

## TREM2 and amyloid pathology

Aβ  accumulation  is  one  of  the  hallmark  pathological  features  of  AD,  contributing  to  neuroinflammation, synaptic  dysfunction,  and  neuronal  loss.  TREM2  plays a  central  role  in  mediating  microglial  responses  to  Aβ, thus serving as a key player in the brain's defense against Aβ  pathology.  TREM2  directly  binds  to  Aβ,  exhibiting particularly  high  affinity  for  Aβ42  oligomers  due  to  the irreversibility  of  this  interaction,  whereas  its  binding  to Aβ42 and Aβ40 monomers is much weaker and reversible [47, 48, 81]. The binding of Aβ to TREM2 triggers a cascade  of  microglial  responses  that  involve  activation, clustering, and enhanced clearance of these toxic aggregates  in  a  TREM2-dependent  manner  [47,  48,  81,  82] (Fig.  2).  Moreover,  TREM2  facilitates  the  clustering  of microglia around Aβ plaques, an essential component of the  microglial  response  to  amyloid  deposition  [82-84]. This clustering helps form a protective barrier around Aβ plaques, sequestering the toxic Aβ and modulating local inflammation, thereby limiting its neurotoxic effects [85]. In  the  absence  of  TREM2,  microglial  clustering  is  significantly impaired, leading to more diffuse and neuritic plaque  morphology,  which  exacerbates  the  neurotoxic effects of Aβ [82, 83, 85, 86] (Fig. 2). Studies in TREM2 KO PS2APP mice have shown that the absence of TREM2 leads to an increase in the Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio and the accumulation of soluble, fibrillar Aβ oligomers [87]. Despite a reduction in plaque load at later ages, these alterations are  linked  to  exacerbated  axonal  dystrophy,  dendritic spine  loss,  and  elevated  levels  of  Nf-L  in  the  CSF  [87]. Notably,  the  more  diffuse  plaque  morphology  observed in  TREM2-deficient  mice,  along  with  the  altered  Aβ profile,  highlights  the  critical  neuroprotective  role  of TREM2 in regulating Aβ aggregation and mitigating neuronal damage. These impairments in microglial responses to Aβ are not restricted to animal models; similar observations have been made in human AD patients carrying TREM2 mutations, where reduced microglial clustering around Aβ plaques and increased neuronal dystrophy are evident, reinforcing the vital role of TREM2 in protecting against Aβ toxicity [82, 85].

TREM2 plays  a  pivotal  role  in  modulating  microglial responses  to  Aβ  accumulation  by  orchestrating  their transition  from  a  homeostatic  state  to  a  fully  activated disease-associated  microglia  (DAM)  state  [88-90].  In amyloidosis mouse models, microglial activation follows a two-step process: an initial TREM2-independent phase characterized  by  the  downregulation  of  homeostatic checkpoint genes and the upregulation of neurodegeneration-associated markers, followed by a TREM2-dependent phase essential for the induction of lipid metabolism and phagocytosis-related genes involved in Aβ clearance. In the absence of TREM2, microglia become trapped in an  intermediate  state,  failing  to  fully  activate  the  DAM program or mount an effective response to Aβ accumulation  [88-90].  Studies  in  amyloid  mouse  models  have demonstrated that the loss of functional TREM2 impairs microglial  clustering  around  amyloid  plaques,  reducing microglial phagocytic capacity and leading to inefficient amyloid clearance [49, 83]. Moreover, TREM2 deficiency results in plaques that are less compact and more fibrillar, which correlates with increased dystrophic neurites and neuronal damage, suggesting that TREM2 plays a critical role in buffering Aβ toxicity [83, 91, 92].

The  protective  role  of  TREM2  is  particularly  evident during  the  early  stages  of  amyloid  deposition.  At  this stage,  TREM2-mediated  signaling  enhances  microglial activation and promotes the clearance of amyloid seeds, thereby  limiting  plaque  formation  [82,  93].  Preclinical  studies  suggest  that  therapeutic  strategies  aimed  at upregulating  TREM2-either  through  increased  gene dosage  or  activating  antibodies-can  enhance  protective  microglial  functions  and  reduce  amyloid  pathology [93-97].  However,  in  later  stages  of  amyloid  pathology, TREM2 upregulation appears to have little or no impact on  plaque  burden,  suggesting  that  its  therapeutic  window may be restricted to early disease progression [93].

Fig. 2 Roles of TREM2 in Alzheimer's disease pathology. In the presence of TREM2, amyloid plaque accumulation activates the disease-associated microglia (DAM) program and/or the microglial neurodegenerative (MGnD) phenotype. Microglia cluster around plaques, trimming the peripheral region of amyloid-β fibrils and compacting the plaque structure. Additionally, they form a protective barrier between plaques and surrounding neural tissue, reducing amyloid-β-induced neuritic dystrophy. In contrast, TREM2 deficiency or mutation disrupts the activation of DAM and/or the MGnD phenotype, significantly decreasing the number of plaque-associated microglia. This results in the formation of loosely packed amyloid-β plaques termed filamentous plaque, accompanied by more severe neuritic dystrophy in adjacent areas. Consequently, tau pathology becomes more pronounced, promoting its accumulation and propagation, which ultimately accelerates neuronal loss

These findings underscore the necessity for stage-specific therapeutic strategies that take into account the dynamic role  of  TREM2  in  AD  progression.  Overall,  TREM2 is  widely  regarded  as  protective  in  amyloid  pathology by  promoting  microglial  clustering,  phagocytosis,  and plaque  compaction  while  reducing  neurotoxicity.  However, its precise effects may be influenced by factors such as  disease  stage,  genetic  background,  and  environmental  conditions. Future research should aim to refine our understanding  of  these  variables  and  develop  targeted therapeutic  approaches  that  maximize  the  beneficial effects of TREM2 while minimizing potential risks.

## TREM2 and tau pathology

Tau  protein  aggregation  and  hyperphosphorylation  are central to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark of AD and other tauopathies. These tau aggregates disrupt neuronal function and connectivity, contributing significantly  to  neurodegeneration.  The  role  of  TREM2 in  tauopathies  is  complex  and  context-dependent,  with its effects often influenced by the presence of Aβ pathology. Studies using mouse models with concurrent Aβ and tau  pathologies,  such  as  the  TauPS2APP  model,  reveal that  TREM2  deficiency  exacerbates  tau  accumulation and propagation, particularly in regions associated with Aβ  plaques  [98].  This  suggests  that  TREM2-dependent

modulation of microglial responses is crucial for limiting Aβ-induced tau spreading. Specifically, in the context of Aβ plaques, TREM2 deficiency promotes tau seeding in dystrophic  neurites  surrounding  plaques  [99,  100].  This heightened tau seeding correlates with reduced microglial clustering around plaques and elevated levels of neurotoxic Aβ42, reinforcing the idea that TREM2-mediated microglial  responses  help  constrain  tau  propagation  by mitigating  Aβ  toxicity  and  protecting  surrounding  neurons [98-100] (Fig. 2).

In  contrast,  TREM2's  role  in  tauopathy  models  without  amyloid  pathology,  for  example  the  PS19  and  hTau models,  is less well-defined, with studies  producing mixed results.  In  the  hTau  mouse  model,  characterized by  human  MAPT  overexpression,  TREM2  deficiency accelerates  tau  phosphorylation  and  aggregation  during  early  disease  progression,  although  its  impact  on neurodegeneration and brain atrophy has not been fully assessed  [101].  Conversely,  in  the  PS19  model,  which expresses  the  human  tau  T34  isoform  (one  N-terminal insert and four microtubule binding repeats, 1N4R) with the P301S mutation, complete TREM2 knockout reduces brain  atrophy  associated  with  tau  pathology  [102].  This protective  effect  of  TREM2  loss  is  linked  to  decreased microgliosis and neuroinflammation, suggesting that TREM2-driven microglial activation may exacerbate neurodegeneration  in  certain  tauopathies.  Supporting this, studies have shown that complete TREM2 loss mitigates tau pathology and brain atrophy in the PS19 model [103].  However,  heterozygous  TREM2  deficiency  shows the opposite effect, intensifying tau pathology, brain atrophy, and pro-inflammatory responses in the same model [103].  These  contrasting  findings  highlight  the  complex effects of TREM2 on tau pathology and the need for caution when extrapolating mouse model results to humans. While  TREM2  deletion  causes  fatal  neurodegenerative diseases  in  humans,  such  as  NHD,  TREM2  knockout mice  generally  exhibit  normal  phenotypes  and  do  not develop  similar  conditions.  This  discrepancy  suggests that species-specific differences may influence TREM2's involvement  in  tau  pathology  and  neurodegeneration. Further studies are required to elucidate these differences and clarify TREM2's role in human tauopathies.

The  TREM2  R47H  variant  offers  additional  insights into TREM2's role in the PS19 tauopathy model, although findings remain inconsistent. In female PS19 mice, where  the  R47H  variant  was  introduced  via  CRISPR/ Cas9-mediated knock-in of human TREM2 R47H cDNA  replacing  endogenous  mTrem2,  spatial  learning and  memory  deficits  were  observed  compared  to  mice expressing the common human TREM2 variant, despite no significant differences in tau pathology [104]. Furthermore, these R47H-expressing mice exhibited exacerbated pro-inflammatory  responses,  suggesting  that  the  R47H

variant alters microglial functions in a manner that worsens  neuroinflammation  and  cognitive  decline,  independent  of  tau  burden.  In  contrast,  in  PS19  models  where the  R47H  variant  was  introduced  via  bacterial  artificial chromosome technology, investigators observed reduced tau  pathology,  attenuated  synaptic  loss,  and  decreased brain atrophy, accompanied by diminished inflammatory responses [105]. These discrepancies are likely driven by differences  in  the  disease  models  and  may  also  reflect sex-dependent  effects,  underscoring  the  complexity  of studying TREM2  R47H  in  tauopathies.  Importantly, studies  have  shown  that  the  TREM2  R47H  variant  disrupts splicing and decreases Trem2 mRNA and protein levels in mice, but not in humans [106]. As a result, generating  humanized TREM2 R47H knock-in mice would be crucial to better understand the cellular effects of the human TREM2 R47H coding variant.

The  interaction  between  TREM2  and  ApoE4  introduces  an  additional  layer  of  complexity  in  tauopathy. In  PS19  tauopathy  mice,  the  presence  of  the  TREM2 R47H  variant  exacerbates  brain  atrophy  specifically  in 9-  to  10-month-old  female  APOE4  mice,  while  male mice  remain  unaffected  [107].  Notably,  this  ventricular enlargement  is  absent  in  female  APOE3-TREM2  R47H tauopathy  mice,  suggesting  that  APOE  isoform  differences  influence  the  impact  of  TREM2  R47H  on  neurodegeneration.  The  exacerbated  brain  atrophy  is  further accompanied  by  increased  tau  hyperphosphorylation in  the  frontal  cortex,  indicating  a  potential  mechanistic  link  between  TREM2  dysfunction,  ApoE4,  and  tau pathology.  Mechanistically,  this  phenotype  is  associated with  an  amplified  microglial  response,  characterized  by heightened activation of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator  of  interferon  genes  (STING)  pathway  and  its  downstream  interferon  response.  This  dysregulated signaling cascade may contribute to microglial senescence, further accelerating tau pathology and neurodegeneration. Supporting this idea, in  PS19  mice expressing  APOE4,  complete  Trem2  knockout  exacerbates  neurodegeneration  and  tau  pathology,  suggesting that  TREM2-mediated microglial functions may exert a protective role in the presence of APOE4 [108]. This finding contrasts with earlier studies where Trem2 knockout in PS19 mice expressing mouse Apoe led to a reduction in tau pathology and neurodegeneration [102, 103], highlighting  a  context-dependent interplay between TREM2 and APOE isoforms in tauopathies.

While large-scale genome-wide association studies  exploring  the  co-occurrence  of  APOE4  and  TREM2 R47H  alleles  in  AD  patients  remain  limited,  existing clinical  data  suggest  a  functional  interaction  between these  variants.  Individuals  carrying  both  APOE4  and TREM2  R47H  exhibit  a  shorter  disease  duration  compared  to  APOE4  carriers  without  TREM2  R47H  [109].

Additionally, one study reported that AD symptoms are more prevalent in individuals harboring both APOE4 and TREM2 R47H than in those carrying TREM2 R47H with APOE3, further suggesting that APOE4 may exacerbate TREM2  R47H-associated  vulnerability  [110].  However, a  separate  large-scale  analysis,  including  neuropathologically confirmed AD cases, found that a subset of individuals carrying only the TREM2 R47H variant-without APOE4-also  develop  AD  pathology  [111],  indicating that TREM2 R47H alone may be sufficient to drive disease progression in some cases.

In summary, the evidence strongly supports a protective  role  for  TREM2  in  amyloid-induced  tauopathy,  a model more closely resembling AD pathology. However,

TREM2's  role  in  tauopathy  without  amyloid  pathology remains ambiguous and complex, with outcomes varying based  on  disease  context  and  models.  Further  research is  needed  to  fully  elucidate  how  TREM2  modulates  tau pathology, particularly in the presence of different genetic backgrounds and environmental factors.

## TREM2 as a soluble form (sTREM2)

## The biogenesis of sTREM2

The  biogenesis  of  sTREM2  is  a  multifaceted  process involving  two  primary  pathways:  proteolytic  shedding and alternative  splicing  (Fig.  3).  Proteolytic  shedding  of TREM2 is primarily mediated by enzymes of a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) family, with ADAM10 and

Fig. 3 Schematic illustration of sTREM2 production in microglia. This diagram illustrates two primary mechanisms underlying the generation of sTREM2: the proteolytic cleavage pathway and the splicing pathway. In the proteolytic cleavage pathway, the ectodomain of TREM2 is cleaved by metalloproteases, with ADAM10/17 cleaving at the H157-S158 bond and meprin β cleaving at the R136-D137 bond, resulting in the release of sTREM2 into the extracellular space. Alternatively, in the splicing pathway, mRNA variants of TREM2 are generated through splicing events, producing soluble forms of TREM2 that are also released extracellularly. Specifically, ENST00000373113 represents the canonical TREM2 transcript, consisting of five exons, while ENST00000338469 lacks exon 4, which encodes the transmembrane domain. Additionally, ENST00000373122 lacks exon 5 and has an alternative start site at exon 4, resulting in a different coding sequence. The box in the middle highlights the genetic modifiers influencing sTREM2 levels in the CSF

<!-- image -->

ADAM17 being the key players in this  process  [15-17, 112, 113]. These enzymes cleave the extracellular domain of  TREM2 at the histidine 157-serine 158 (H157-S158) site, as confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis [15, 112, 113].  While  ADAM17  has  been  implicated  in  sTREM2 production  in  human  macrophages  and  CHO  cell  lines [15],  other  studies  emphasize  the  role  of  ADAM10  in TREM2 shedding in HEK293 cells and murine microglia [16,  112,  113].  The  exact  roles  of  ADAM10,  ADAM17, and  other  ADAM  family  members  in  sTREM2  generation are not yet fully understood, underscoring the need for  further  investigation  into  their  individual  contributions. In addition to ADAM proteases, meprin β, a zinc metalloproteinase from the astacin family, has been identified as an alternative sheddase [114]. It cleaves TREM2 at  a  distinct  arginine  136-aspartate  137  (R136-D137) site,  contributing to sTREM2 production particularly in macrophages. This highlights the diversity of proteolytic pathways involved in TREM2 shedding.

Alongside proteolytic shedding,  sTREM2  can  also be  generated  via  alternative  splicing  of  TREM2  mRNA (Fig.  3).  This  process  produces  several  transcript  variants,  some  of  which  lack  the  transmembrane  domain, leading  to  the  generation  of  soluble  isoforms.  In  the human brain, four major TREM2 transcripts have been identified: ENST00000373113 (canonical transcript), ENST00000373122 (missing exon 5 and has an alternative start site at exon 4), ENST00000338469 (lacking exon 4),  and  TREM2Δe2  (missing  exon  2)  [14,  115].  Among these,  ENST00000338469,  which  lacks  the  transmembrane  domain,  represents  approximately  20-25%  of  the total TREM2 mRNA in the brain [14]. Notably, both the ENST00000338469 and ENST00000373122 isoforms are translated  and  secreted  as  sTREM2,  further  supporting the idea that alternative splicing plays a significant role in sTREM2 production [116].

In summary, sTREM2 is generated through two complementary mechanisms: (i) proteolytic shedding of the TREM2 ectodomain and (ii)  translation  of  alternatively spliced  TREM2  transcripts  lacking  the  transmembrane domain.  While  both  processes  contribute  to  sTREM2 production,  the  precise  balance  between  these  pathways and their individual roles in different cell types and conditions remain areas for further exploration. A more thorough  understanding  of  these  mechanisms  is  essential for elucidating the biological significance of sTREM2, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.

## Genetic modifiers of sTREM2 levels

CSF levels of sTREM2 are notably elevated in neurodegenerative disorders, positioning sTREM2 as a dynamic biomarker  that  reflects  key  pathological  processes  in AD.  Consequently,  understanding  the  genetic  factors that  influence  sTREM2  levels  has  emerged  as  a  critical area of research, providing critical insights into their contributions to AD pathogenesis and potential avenues for therapeutic intervention. A major focus has been on variants within the TREM2 gene itself (Fig. 3). NHD and FTD-associated TREM2 variants, including Q33X, Y38C, and T66M, are associated with significantly reduced CSF sTREM2 levels compared to non-carriers [16, 117]. These reductions align with studies showing that such variants impair  the  cell-surface  localization  of  TREM2,  thereby decreasing its proteolytic shedding into sTREM2 [16]. In contrast, the AD-associated R47H variant is linked to elevated CSF sTREM2 levels, suggesting enhanced shedding or  altered  regulation  [117,  118].  Similarly,  the  H157Y variant  accelerates  TREM2  shedding,  further  highlighting  the  diverse  effects  of  TREM2  variants  on  sTREM2 dynamics [112, 119]. Collectively, these findings highlight the complex interplay between TREM2 genetic variants and the regulation of sTREM2 production, underscoring the importance of further research to better understand these  mechanisms  and  their  implications  for  neurodegenerative diseases.

Beyond  variants  in  TREM2,  other  genetic  loci  have been identified as modifiers of sTREM2 levels, with the membrane-spanning  4-domains  subfamily  A  (MS4A) gene  cluster  being  particularly  significant.  MS4A  proteins are transmembrane receptors involved in cell activation  by  working  as  ion  channels  or  by  modulating the  signaling  of  other  immunoreceptors.  They  play  key roles in different pathological settings, including cancer, infectious  diseases,  and  neurodegeneration  [120].  Variants  such  as  rs1582763  in  the  MS4A  region  are  associated  with  increased  CSF  sTREM2  levels,  reduced  AD risk,  and  delayed  disease  onset  [121].  Conversely,  the rs6591561 variant, encoding the MS4A4A p.M159V protein,  is  linked  to  lower  CSF  sTREM2  levels,  heightened AD risk,  and  earlier  disease  onset.  Single-nucleus  transcriptomic analysis of brain tissue from carriers of these variants  identified  a  distinct  microglial  subpopulation regulated  by  MS4A4A  expression  [122].  The  protective variant enhances MS4A4A expression, shifting microglia toward  an  anti-inflammatory  state  characterized  by  the expression of interferon and lipid metabolism genes. In contrast, the risk variant in MS4A4A suppresses this cell state,  promoting  pro-inflammatory  cytokine  pathways and impairing lipid metabolism. These findings highlight a mechanistic link between MS4A4A regulation, microglial functions, and sTREM2 generation, presenting potential  therapeutic avenues targeting the MS4A pathway to modulate microglial resilience and AD progression.

Other novel genetic modifiers of sTREM2  levels include  loci  associated  with  the  Transforming  Growth Factor Beta Receptor 2 (TGFBR2) and Nectin Cell Adhesion  Molecule  2  (NECTIN2)  genes  [123].  TGFBR2  is

a  receptor  for  TGF-β  signaling,  which  regulates  various cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation,  immune response, and fibrosis [124]. NECTIN2 is a  cell  adhesion  molecule  critical  for  forming  synaptic junctions,  immune  synapses,  and  viral  entry  [125].  Its genetic associations have been implicated in a variety of human  diseases,  including  AD,  coronary  heart  disease, and multiple sclerosis. Variants such as rs73823326 in the TGFBR2 region and rs11666329 in the NECTIN2 region have  been  linked  to  altered  CSF  sTREM2  levels  [123]. Lentivirus-mediated overexpression of NECTIN2  or TGFBR2 in macrophages derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells results in a significant increase in  extracellular  sTREM2  levels,  without  affecting  total TREM2 expression. This suggests the role of NECTIN2 and  TGFBR2  in  selectively  modulating  sTREM2  levels. Both genes are highly expressed in microglia and encode transmembrane  proteins,  suggesting  they  may  regulate CSF sTREM2 by influencing the proteolytic cleavage of TREM2  at  the  cell  membrane.  These  findings  emphasize  the  potential  of  NECTIN2  and  TGFBR2  as  novel therapeutic targets for AD, highlighting the importance of understanding genetic factors that influence sTREM2 levels in neurodegeneration.

## Dynamic changes of sTREM2 levels across AD progression

The role of sTREM2 as a biomarker in AD has attracted significant  interest  due  to  its  capacity  to  reflect  neuroinflammatory  processes  and  track  the  stages  of  disease progression.  Cross-sectional  studies  consistently  show that CSF sTREM2 levels are elevated in AD patients compared  to  cognitively  normal  individuals,  supporting  its relevance in AD pathology [18, 19, 21, 117, 126]. Notably, sTREM2 levels exhibit stage-specific variation, peaking during the early symptomatic stages of AD (Fig. 4A). Data from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) reveals  that  sTREM2  levels  increase  in  familial AD mutation  carriers  up  to  five  years  before  and  after symptom onset [19], highlighting its potential as an early biomarker for neuroinflammatory changes that may precede clinical manifestations.

The  relationship  between  elevated  CSF  sTREM2  levels, cognitive function, and AD pathology has been well documented.  Studies  indicate  that  in  mild  cognitive impairment  (MCI)  patients,  higher  sTREM2  levels  correlate with increased gray matter volume in brain regions vulnerable  to  AD  [127].  Longitudinal  research  further shows that higher baseline sTREM2 levels are associated with slower cognitive decline over an 11-year period in AD  patients  who  test  positive  for  key  AD  biomarkers, such as Aβ42 and p-tau181 [21] (Fig. 4B). Additionally, a higher sTREM2 to p-tau181 ratio predicts a slower rate of progression from MCI to AD dementia. In autosomal dominant AD, elevated sTREM2 levels have been linked to  reduced  Aβ  pathology  and  slower  cognitive  decline, particularly  during  the  pre-symptomatic  phase,  further emphasizing  sTREM2's  potential  neuroprotective  role [23]. Interestingly, higher CSF sTREM2 levels also appear to mitigate the ApoE4-associated risk of cognitive decline and AD-related neurodegeneration, suggesting that

Fig. 4 Dynamic changes of sTREM2 across AD spectrum. ( A ) The levels of sTREM2 in CSF gradually increase throughout the AD continuum, correlating with microglial activation. This increase reaches its peak during the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage and subsequently plateaus or even declines in the dementia stage. ( B ) In elderly individuals, higher baseline CSF sTREM2 concentrations are associated with slower cognitive decline, particularly in memory and overall cognition. Furthermore, elevated sTREM2 levels correlate with a slower rate of hippocampal atrophy

Fig. 5 Potential roles of sTREM2 in Alzheimer's disease pathology. The sTREM2, generated upon microglial activation, plays a crucial role in modulating AD pathology. It has been shown to inhibit Aβ oligomerization, fibrillization, and neurotoxicity. Additionally, sTREM2 promotes microglial activation, enhancing several microglial functions, including increased cell proliferation, migration, clustering around amyloid plaques, and the uptake and degradation of Aβ. These actions collectively reduce amyloid plaque burden and the number of dystrophic neurites. Additionally, sTREM2 interacts with transgelin-2 (TG2), leading to the deactivation of GSK3β and reducing tau phosphorylation. This process helps prevent neuronal loss and alleviates cognitive and behavioral impairments sTREM2 may have broader implications in neurodegenerative disease risk [128].

While these findings highlight the importance of sTREM2  as  a  biomarker  in  AD,  it  remains  unclear whether  the  elevated  sTREM2  levels  reflect  an  overall  increase  in  TREM2  expression  due  to  inflammation, selective enhancement of proteolytic processing, or altered splicing of TREM2. The precise mechanisms contributing  to  the  dynamics  of  sTREM2  in  AD  pathogenesis warrant further exploration. Elevated sTREM2 levels may reflect increased proteolytic cleavage of TREM2 at the  cell  membrane,  potentially  regulated  by  factors  like MS4A4A, TGFBR2 or NECTIN2, which can selectively modulate sTREM2  shedding without affecting total TREM2  expression.  Alternatively,  changes  in  TREM2 splicing  could  also  contribute  to  higher  sTREM2  levels, although this remains to be investigated in more detail. Understanding  these  mechanisms  will  provide  deeper insight into the role of sTREM2 in AD and its potential for therapeutic targeting.

Taken  together,  these  findings  underscore  the  complex  and  dynamic  role  of  sTREM2  in  AD  progression, positioning it as both a valuable biomarker and a potential  therapeutic  target.  Ongoing  longitudinal  studies  are critical to fully elucidate the mechanisms through which sTREM2 influences disease progression and to explore its application in therapeutic strategies aimed at modifying AD's trajectory.

## sTREM2 in amyloid and tau pathology

sTREM2  plays  a  critical  role  in  neurodegenerative  diseases,  especially  AD,  by  influencing  both  amyloid  and tau pathologies (Fig. 5). Research suggests that sTREM2 functions  with  chaperone-like  activity,  helping  mitigate the toxic effects of Aβ [129]. In vitro studies have shown that sTREM2 preferentially binds to oligomeric forms of Aβ, inhibiting their aggregation and reducing the neurotoxic  effects  that  accelerate  disease  progression.  While these  findings  suggest  that  sTREM2  may  help  limit  the damaging consequences of Aβ accumulation, further in vivo studies are needed to confirm the relevance of this mechanism in AD brain. Conversely, the R47H variant of sTREM2 exhibits reduced binding affinity for Aβ oligomers, which could promote harmful Aβ aggregation and increase toxicity.

In  addition  to  its  role  in  modulating  Aβ  aggregation, sTREM2 plays a pivotal role in regulating key microglial functions,  including  survival,  proliferation,  migration, and phagocytosis. These processes are essential for maintaining  brain  homeostasis  and  mounting  an  effective response  to  pathological  changes  in  neurodegenerative diseases  such  as  AD.  Our  study  in  primary  microglial cultures  demonstrated  that  sTREM2  enhances  microglial survival through a PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway and stimulates the production of inflammatory cytokines via NF-κB  signaling  [130].  Importantly,  sTREM2  induces microglial  activation  in  the  mouse  brain  independently of full-length TREM2.  Furthermore, in the  5xFAD mouse  model,  sTREM2  promotes  microglial  proliferation, facilitates migration and clustering around amyloid plaques, and enhances the uptake and degradation of Aβ [20].  However,  the  R47H  variant  significantly  impairs sTREM2's ability to promote microglial survival and activate immune responses [130], which may contribute to a more aggressive disease course in AD patients carrying this variant.

Additional  evidence  supporting  the  protective  role  of sTREM2 in  AD  comes  from  in  vivo  experiments  using transgenic AD mouse models. Administration of recombinant sTREM2 to amyloidogenic mice has been shown to promote microglial clustering around amyloid plaques, which  may  reduce  neurite  dystrophy  associated  with these deposits [20] (Fig. 5). Moreover, sTREM2 reduces amyloid  plaque  load  and  improves  cognitive  function, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for preventing  or  reversing  amyloid  pathology  [20].  Interestingly, studies indicate that specific fragments of sTREM2 are  more  efficient  at  binding  Aβ  and  reducing  amyloid deposition  compared  to  full-length  sTREM2,  suggesting  that  these  selected  fragments  could  serve  as  more effective  therapeutic  interventions  [131].  Gene  therapy approaches involving adeno-associated virus  (AAV)mediated  overexpression  of  sTREM2  have  conferred significant  neuroprotection,  improving  brain  function and reducing amyloid pathology in transgenic mice [20]. In  contrast,  studies  using  transgenic  mice  with  altered TREM2 shedding-via  mutations  in  the  ADAM  protease cleavage site-reveal that reduced membrane TREM2 cleavage  exacerbates  amyloid  deposition  and  neuronal degeneration,  highlighting  the  importance  of  regulated TREM2 shedding for optimal brain health [132].

In  addition  to  its  role  in  amyloid  pathology,  sTREM2 has also been implicated in tau pathophysiology (Fig. 5). Elevated  CSF  levels  of  sTREM2  are  associated  with

slower  tau  aggregation  in  Aβ-positive  individuals  who do  not  yet  exhibit  dementia,  suggesting  that  sTREM2 may delay tau-related neurodegeneration in the preclinical  stages  of  AD  [133].  Functional  magnetic  resonance imaging  (MRI)  analyses  further  support  these  findings, linking higher CSF sTREM2 levels to reduced tau deposition across key brain regions involved in AD. These data underscore  sTREM2's  potential  role  in  the  early  stages of tau pathology and its promise as a biomarker for taurelated  changes  in  AD.  In  PS19  mice,  AAV-mediated overexpression  of  sTREM2  significantly  attenuates  tau pathology, preventing tau aggregation and rescuing cognitive and behavioral deficits (Fig. 5). This reinforces the idea that increasing sTREM2 expression may offer therapeutic  benefits  against  tau-related  neurodegeneration [22].  Additionally,  sTREM2  has  been  shown  to  interact with transgelin-2 (TG2), deactivates the GSK3β and ameliorates tau phosphorylation. These findings suggest that sTREM2 plays a role in stabilizing tau, thereby reducing its neurotoxic effects.

In  summary, these findings highlight the dual protective roles of sTREM2 in both amyloid and tau pathologies in  AD.  By  modulating  immune  responses  and  mitigating  the  neurotoxic  aggregation  of  pathological  proteins, sTREM2 emerges as a promising therapeutic target. As research  advances,  sTREM2  may  play  a  pivotal  role  in the development of novel interventions aimed at slowing or even reversing the progression of AD. This positions sTREM2 not only as a biomarker for early disease detection but also as a potential therapeutic target for a range of  neurodegenerative  disorders.  Continued  exploration of the specific molecular mechanisms by which sTREM2 regulates  AD  pathology  will  be  crucial  for  developing therapeutic  strategies  that  promote  neuroprotection  in AD.

## Future perspectives and clinical implications

TREM2, both as a cell-surface receptor and in its soluble form,  has  emerged  as  a  pivotal  player  in  AD  and  other neurodegenerative disorders. Partial loss-of-function variants of TREM2 are strongly associated with increased AD risk, underscoring its protective role in maintaining microglial homeostasis. Concurrently, elevated CSF levels  of  sTREM2 have been correlated with slower cognitive  decline  and  attenuated  disease  progression,  further emphasizing its clinical significance. These findings collectively  highlight  TREM2  and  sTREM2  as  promising targets  for  therapeutic  intervention.  However,  the  precise mechanisms through which they modulate microglial functions and influence amyloid and tau pathologies remain incompletely understood, warranting further research.  Future  studies  should  focus  on  delineating the  molecular  mechanisms  that  regulate  TREM2  and sTREM2 and exploring their interplay with genetic and environmental factors.

Therapeutic strategies targeting TREM2 and sTREM2 represent  complementary  approaches  with  significant potential in mitigating AD. Agonistic antibodies designed to activate TREM2 signaling have shown preclinical efficacy by enhancing microglial protective functions, reducing  amyloid  burden,  and  mitigating  neuroinflammation [13, 69, 96, 97, 134, 135]. These promising findings have led  to  ongoing  clinical  trials  evaluating  the  safety  and therapeutic benefits of TREM2 activation in AD patients [13].  Despite  these  promising  findings,  the  therapeutic modulation of TREM2 remains complex. While studies on  TREM2  deficiency  suggest  that  TREM2  constrains amyloid-induced tau pathology, chronic treatment with  the  agonistic  TREM2  antibody  AL002a  has  been reported to enhance the seeding and spreading of phosphorylated  tau,  exacerbating  neuritic  dystrophy  [136]. These findings underscore the context-dependent nature of TREM2-targeting therapies, highlighting the need for further  investigations  to  determine  the  optimal  timing, disease stage, and microglial functional states that shape treatment outcomes.

Meanwhile, the neuroprotective properties of sTREM2 position it as an additional target for therapeutic development.  Both  preclinical  and  clinical  evidence  linking elevated sTREM2 levels to reduced amyloid and tau pathologies,  as  well  as  improved  cognitive  outcomes, underscores  the  rationale  for  interventions  aimed  at enhancing sTREM2 production or mimicking its protective effects. A combination of TREM2-targeted therapies and sTREM2-based interventions could potentially provide synergistic benefits for comprehensive disease modification.  However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  several TREM2 agonistic antibodies reportedly bind to the same epitope shared by full-length TREM2 and sTREM2 [69, 95].  This  interaction  may  interfere  with  the  protective functions  of  sTREM2,  warranting  careful  consideration in the design of therapeutic strategies.

The timing and context of these interventions are critical,  as  the  roles  of  TREM2  and  sTREM2  appear  to  be dependent  on  the  disease  stage.  Long-term  therapeutic strategies  must  take  into  account  these  stage-specific roles to maximize their efficacy. For example, during the early  stages  of  amyloid  seeding,  TREM2  signaling  plays a  crucial  role  in  facilitating  the  clearance  of  amyloid seeds,  thereby  preventing  further  plaque  formation  [82, 93]. However, its effects appear to be less pronounced in later stages of amyloid pathology. Similarly, sTREM2 levels  fluctuate in a stage-dependent manner, peaking during the early symptomatic phase of AD [18, 19]. Elevated sTREM2 levels have been associated with a reduction in Aβ accumulation and a slower rate of cognitive decline, particularly in the pre-symptomatic stage [21, 23]. These

findings  underscore  the  stage-specific  roles  of  TREM2 and  sTREM2  in  AD  pathology,  highlighting  the  importance  of  precise  therapeutic  timing  and  the  use  of  biomarkers  that  reflect  disease  progression  and  microglial activity to optimize intervention strategies.

From  a  diagnostic  perspective,  sTREM2  shows  considerable potential as a biomarker for the early detection of  AD  and  for  monitoring  disease  progression.  Studies using TSPO-PET imaging have demonstrated a correlation between sTREM2 levels in CSF and TSPO signaling in  neurodegenerative  diseases  [69,  137],  indicating  that sTREM2 may serve as a potential marker for microglial activation.  Since  microglial  activation  is  an  early  and pivotal  event  in  the  pathogenesis  of  AD,  CSF  sTREM2 could  be  a  valuable  marker  for  monitoring  this  process in  clinical  settings.  Moreover,  sTREM2  levels  can  help distinguish AD patients at various stages of the disease, facilitating  more  tailored  and  personalized  treatment strategies.  Monitoring  sTREM2  levels  during  treatment may  enable  clinicians  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  a therapeutic intervention and make timely adjustments as needed. Additionally, elevated CSF sTREM2 levels have been suggested to be associated with a decreased risk of MCI-to-AD  conversion  [138].  Therefore,  CSF  sTREM2 levels  may  serve  as  a  predictor  of  cognitive  outcomes, enabling the identification of patients who are more likely to benefit from specific interventions and enhancing the precision of clinical decision-making.

In summary, TREM2 and sTREM2 represent interconnected  therapeutic  and  diagnostic  opportunities  in  AD. Advancing  our  understanding  of  their  roles,  regulatory mechanisms,  and  clinical  applications  will  enable  the development  of  targeted  interventions  that  can  modify disease  progression.  Integrating  these  insights  into  precision  medicine  strategies  holds  substantial  potential to  enhance  the  quality  of  life  for  patients  with  AD  and related neurodegenerative disorders.
