## Abstract

Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent form of dementia leading to memory loss, reduced cognitive and linguistic abilities, and decreased self-care. Current AD treatments aim to relieve symptoms and slow disease progression, but a cure is elusive due to limited understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms.

Main content Stem cell technology has the potential to revolutionize AD research. With the ability to self-renew and differentiate into various cell types, stem cells are valuable tools for disease modeling, drug screening, and cell therapy. Recent advances have broadened our understanding beyond the deposition of amyloidβ (Aβ) or tau proteins in AD to encompass risk genes, immune system disorders, and neuron-glia mis-communication, relying heavily on stem cell-derived disease models. These stem cell-based models (e.g., organoids and microfluidic chips) simulate in vivo pathological processes with extraordinary spatial and temporal resolution. Stem cell technologies have the potential to alleviate AD pathology through various pathways, including immunomodulation, replacement of damaged neurons, and neurotrophic support. In recent years, transplantation of glial cells like oligodendrocytes and the infusion of exosomes have become hot research topics.

Conclusion Although stem cell-based models and therapies for AD face several challenges, such as extended culture time and low differentiation efficiency, they still show considerable potential for AD treatment and are likely to become preferred tools for AD research.

## Introduction

Alzheimer's  disease  (AD)  is  a  common,  chronic  neurodegenerative  disorder  characterized  by  the  extensive distribution of neuronal tangles and amyloid plaques in the  brain  along  with  astrogliosis,  neuroinflammation, synaptotoxicity,  neuronal  loss,  and  vascular  alterations [28]. In recent decades, AD has been a subject of intensive  research,  however,  no  cure  has  been  developed  to date due to a limited understanding of AD pathogenesis. Fortunately, stem cells-as a category of cells with multidirectional  differentiation  potential-present  new  and powerful tools for AD disease modeling, drug screening, and cell therapy.

The  conventional  animal  models  used  to  study  AD, which  is  mainly  constructed  through  transgenesis  or

induced aging, have considerable limitations due to the complexity  of  the  human  cerebellum,  such  as  neuronal sub-type changes [45]. Stem cell-based models show significant  potential  for  solving  these  problems.  By  reprogramming donor somatic cells with disease morphology, one  can  obtain  induced  pluripotent  stem  cells  (iPSCs) with the ability to expand and differentiate, thereby freeing researchers from reliance on animal models. Moreover,  the  ability  to  culture  3D  iPSC-based  organoids  and construct humanized AD models has enabled researchers to  explore  other  possible  factors  related  to  pathogenesis,  such  as  immune  system  disorders,  impaired  synapses,  abnormal  mitochondrial  structure  and  function, and  mutations  in  risk  genes  (Figure  1).  As  the  amyloid hypothesis continues to be investigated [99], understanding  the  contributions  of  these  pathological  phenomena to disease etiology and neuronal death is of great importance for understanding AD pathogenesis and developing new therapies.

The development of stem cell modeling technology has also launched a new era of personalized pharmaceuticals. Current  drug  screening  methods  are  expensive,  timeconsuming, and complicated. In contrast, stem cell-based models  can  accurately  simulate  pathological  changes in  the  AD  brain,  providing  more  possibilities  for  ADrelated  drug  screening.  Using  stem  cell  technology,  we can understand the effects of drugs at the earliest stage of analytical development and testing and make accurate assessments of their side effects and efficacy.

Currently, Aβ and tau pathologies remain the focus of new  therapies  undergoing  clinical  trials  for  AD,  which include monoclonal antibodies targeting Aβ[50, 88, 109, 131],  the  β-secretase  (BACE1)  inhibitor  that  inhibits secretase activity to lessen Aβ deposition [35], and drugs that target tau protein [94]. Unfortunately, most clinical trials have not achieved good results and some have been terminated due to serious side effects [193]. Such cases demonstrate  the challenges of sub-cellular therapies while highlighting the advantages of stem cell therapies, such as the possibility of reversing the entire pathological process  of  AD  [136,  142].  Transplantation  of  stem  cells in animal models has been shown to provide significant benefits  by  affecting  multiple  pathological  mechanisms and  ultimately  improving  cognitive  function  [103].  Targeting  ganglion  stem  cells  in  the  body  to  activate  and generate new glial cells or neurons is another strategy for stem cell therapy. New targets have been recently identified in animal models to produce these pro-regenerative effects [77].

However, the heterogeneity of stem cells and their survival and migration rates after transplantation limit their applications. Researchers have attempted to address these  issues  through  methods  like  modifying  stem  cell encapsulation, pretreatment, or co-delivery. Alternatively,  direct  use  of  stem  cell-derived  exosomes  for  AD treatment may achieve better results than various complex stem cell modification methods [128], as they show significantly improved pathology and cognitive function in  preclinical  experiments.  Their  therapeutic  potential may  be  even  further  exploited  after  engineering.  For example,  the  production  of  exosomes  can  be  increased by  3D  culture  or  co-culture  with  chloroquine,  NH4Cl, and  other  molecules.  Also,  by  changing  the  content  of oxygen, hydrogen ions, and nutrients in stem cell culture medium,  the  release  of  exosomes  can  be  altered,  however, this may require exploration through further experiments.  Fusion  of  protein  sequences  or  peptides  with exosome membranes can also be used to build devices for targeted delivery, and electroporation is the most widely used method for membrane fusion [181].

In  this  review,  we  summarize  progress  in  stem  cellderived AD models and the principles and applications of stem cells and derived therapies to alleviate AD pathology. We then discuss the prospects of stem cells as models for further investigation of AD pathogenesis and drug screening, as well as application prospects and development directions for stem cells and derived therapies targeting AD.

## Stem cell-derived disease models in AD research

Stem cells are a category of cells with the potential of selfrenewal and multidirectional differentiation. They originate from various tissues such as placenta, adipose tissue, and  dental  pulp  and  have  numerous  potentially  useful  functions such as tissue and organ regeneration and treatment of diseases (especially severe diseases).

One crucial application of stem cells in AD research is the creation of patient-derived human cellular models.  Examples  of  these  are  organoids  and  assembled spheroids, which are multicellular models composed of different brain cell types. These models can be used to test the impact of genetic, chemical, and environmental factors on AD, as well as to evaluate new genetic engineering and genome editing techniques to unravel disease  pathogenesis.  Another  area  where  stem  cells  are used  is  the  development  of  in  vivo  models  that  more accurately  reflect  human  physiology  and  disease,  such as  humanized  animal  models.  As  transplanted  stem cells or their derived tissues/organs retain their original features and functions, humanized models constructed by  transplanting  stem  cells  of  human  origin  into  animals  can  circumvent  ethical constraints associated with human experimentation [164]. Utilizing information on AD-related risk genes, biological processes and pathways, and biomarkers provided by advanced multiomics  technologies,  such  as single-cell and  spatial

Fig. 1 Possible pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. A Amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by BACE1 and other enzymes in the amyloid pathogenic pathway to form different isoforms of Aβ (this process can also be affected by gene mutations), which rapidly aggregate to form neurotoxic oligomers that can induce synaptic loss and further cause cognitive impairment and dementia. Simultaneously, Aβ can contribute to tau pathology by increasing abnormal phosphorylation and the formation of toxic neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which can lead to neurodegeneration. According to the synaptic defect hypothesis, synaptic damage is the underlying cause of AD and defective synapses may lead to the formation of neurotoxic Aβ. B One potential mechanism of AD progression is dysregulation of multiple metabolic pathways. Microglia glucose metabolism disruption promotes a vicious cycle of "glycolysis-histone lactation-PKM2", leading to an imbalance of microglia homeostasis and neuroinflammation. Astrocyte metabolic failure also impairs the neurotransmitter glutamate/GABA glutamine cycle and causes synaptic dysfunction. C Dysfunctional mitochondrial dynamics can result in aberrant mitochondrial fusion fission, in turn causing synaptic degeneration and neuronal injury. Such dynamics include diminished expression of the proteins that control this process. By transferring healthy mitochondria, astrocytes could reduce the negative effects of damaged mitochondria on neurons. This function is blocked in chronic inflammatory situations, which may hasten AD progression. The removal of Aβ and emergence of tau disease may also be impacted by aberrant mitochondrial autophagy. D Microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes have pro-inflammatory phenotypes that promote neuroinflammation and the development of AD. The three types of glial cells interact with one another to speed up neuroinflammation. For example, activated microglia secrete IL-1a, TNF-a, and C1q, which cause reactive astrocytes to develop into the A1 neurotoxic phenotype, whereas oligodendrocytes cause astrocytes to develop into the NF-B signaling or A1 phenotype. Other harmful processes in AD include the attack of Aβ on its own neuronal cell membranes and bacterial-viral infection. E Mutations in common risk genes, including APOE, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), CLU, and CD33, may disrupt normal functions-particularly lipid metabolism in glial cells-thereby increasing the risk of AD development

transcriptomics, long-range sequencing, next-generation  proteomics,  and  other  high-throughput  cellular phenotyping platforms, stem-cell-derived disease models can provide comprehensive insights into the pathogenesis,  progression,  and  drug  screening  of  AD  [182, 185, 186, 194, 196, 199].

## 2D culture systems

The in vitro model of human iPSCs was first established in 2007 in the laboratory of Prof. Shinya Yamanaka [125]. More  than  a  decade  later,  iPSCs  have  been  differentiated into various pathogenic cell types including neurons and  glial  cells  to  mimic  central  nervous  system  (CNS)

developmental processes and profile disease phenotypes. To  promote  the  differentiation  of  iPSCs  into  the  above cell types in 2D culture and prohibit their differentiation to mesoderm or endoderm, dual TGF-β (SMAD) inhibition is utilized to generate neural stem cells (NSCs) with higher purity [19]. By inhibiting the expression of sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling through enhanced Wnt signaling, [66, 129], NSCs can develop into cortical neurons. Cortical neurons, such as cortical glutamatergic neurons, are  mainly  distributed  in  the  neocortex  and  hippocampus, which are early affected tissues in AD [78]. By further  manipulating  extrinsic  signaling  conditions,  NSCs can differentiate into other disease-related cell types such as  cholinergic  neurons  [11].  Substantial  loss  of  cholinergic  neurons has been observed in the brains of earlystage  AD  patients.  After  prolonged  culture,  neurogenic cultures can undergo gliogenesis conversion to produce various glial cells [18, 42]. Dysfunction of such glial cells is  also  considered a cause of AD pathology. As a result, it is increasingly important to study interactions between various neuronal subtypes and glial cells using such models.  Moreover,  compared  to  using  human-derived  stem cells  of  limited  origin  or  rodent  cell  lines  from  widely varying species, 2D co-culture systems using iPSCs yield highly scalable cell models that enable rapid exploration of cellular pathophysiology,  including  transcriptional, genetic, and signaling pathways [136, 142].

## 3D culture systems

To solve the problem of simulating AD pathology in vivo, 3D  neuronal  culture  technology,  has  been  developed based on 2D cell culture systems. Unlike traditional 2D cultures, 3D neuronal cultures better simulate the natural  environment  for  cell  survival  in  organisms,  thereby achieving  cell-cell  interactions  and  more  realistic  biochemical  and  physiological  responses.  To  date,  many rigid scaffolds have been developed to support neuronal culture,  including  super-porous/non-porous  hydrogels, polydimethylsiloxane with micrometric cavities [14], sintered  titanium  [70],  and  hydrogels  or  matrigels  [59]. 3D  soft  matrix  scaffolds  can  also  be  constructed  using hydrogels,  fibronectin-bound  differentiated  iPSCs,  and 3D  printing  techniques.  Not  only  do  these  approaches maintain the electrophysiological activity of neural tissue compared to rigid scaffolds, but they also allow the mimics to be made into different shapes as needed to accommodate multiple platform applications.

Although  scaffolds  can  somewhat  better  mimic  the developing  brain,  they  still  lack  the  cellular  diversity, structural complexity, and physical structure visible in vivo [5]. The development of 3D organoid models and microfluidic organoids has effectively addressed some of these  deficiencies.  3D  organoids  are  grown  from  iPSCs generated from human stem cells or adult cells and have a  similar  composition  and  structure  as  primary  tissues as  well  as  ease  of  manipulation  and  cryopreservation. Organoids have been shown to have well-defined radial glial  cells,  astrocytes,  and  neurons  that  better  mimic human cortical structure during development or in disease states [22, 102, 170]. Early brain organoids derived from  directed  neuroectodermal  differentiation  did  not contain mesodermal lineage cells, such as myeloid microglia or endothelial cells [213]. However, this can now be achieved by co-culturing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and microglia-like cells isolated from primary tissues or differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) with brain organoids [209]. Functional microglia  can  also  be  directly  generated  from  modified unguided  protocols  [201]  or  hESCs  in  human  cortical organoids  (hCOs)  [167].  The  multiple  types  of  human brain  cells  contained  in  the  above  organoids  play  an important role in neurodevelopment and the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases [206]. As a result, 3D organoids can be used to study human diseases that are difficult to simulate using animal models, such as AD.

Microfluidic  organ-on-a-chip  technology,  which  is  a 'human-on-a-chip' cell culture system for studying physiological  processes,  can  be  used  to  grow  neurons,  glial cells,  endothelial  cells,  and  skeletal  muscle  cells  while providing a highly fluidic extracellular environment and maintaining fluid isolation with a multi-lumen device to better  outline  organ-like  structures  [47].  This  approach also  allows  one  to  manipulate  biological  specimens  and cells  and  simulate  pathological  conditions  with  extraordinary spatial and temporal resolution to reveal mechanistic insights into the disease, thereby accelerating drug discovery, screening, and toxicology research [118, 159].

## Humanized animal models

Humanized  animals  are animals carrying functional human  genes,  cells, tissues  and/or  organs,  immune system,  or  microorganisms  that  are  used  in  biomedical  research.  As  they  can  fully  simulate  the  pathological  phenotypes  and  disease  mechanisms  of  human  AD, humanized AD animal models play an important role in AD  research.  There  have  been  recent  developments  of genetically humanized AD animal models. For example, Pang et al. [202] successfully developed a gene knock-in rat model capable of fully simulating AD and more accurately simulating AD pathogenesis in the brain. Andersen et  al.  [162]  used  CRISPR-Cas9-based  gene  editing  to develop a haploid insufficiency model of sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) (which encodes the endosomal recycling  receptor)  in  Gögenting's  miniature  pigs,  providing support for studying the pathological characteristics of  AD  caused  by SORL1 haploinsufficiency.  However,

at  present,  the  use  of  stem  cell  transplantation  technology to establish cellular humanized animal models-also known  as  chimeras-is  mainly  applied  in  the  research fields of immunology  autoimmunity,  transplantation, infectious  diseases,  and  tumors,  and  is  not  widely  used to study neurodegenerative diseases like AD. To create a humanized AD model, [16] transplanted cortical neurons produced  from  human  iPSCs  into  the  brains  of  transgenic  Tg  (APP/PS1-21)  mice.  Their  goal  was  to  reveal species-specific  vulnerability  of  human  neurons  to  AD pathology.  Disease  processes  and  treatment  advancements in AD have been clarified by this model. Another humanized AD model was constructed by Espuny-Camacho et al. [177], who transplanted healthy human neural precursor cells (NPCs) from iPSCs into the frontal cortex of immunodeficient neonatal transgenic APP/PS1-21 mice [177]. Their study revealed significant degeneration of  transplanted  healthy  human  neurons  upon  exposure to Aβ, microglia, and astrocytes [101]. Chimeric models based on stem cell technology can offer further insights into  AD  pathogenesis.  For  example,  by  constructing  a chimeric  mouse  model  with  grafted  Clusterin  (CLU) C (CLU    rs11136000 C mutation)  medial  ganglionic  eminence  progenitors  (CLU  hiMGEs),  Chen  et  al.  clarified that  over-activation  of  the  sphingolipid  pathway  may be the underlying mechanism of CLU AD. Using   CLU C

humanized mice, the study shed light on AD pathogenesis, and highlighted the need for more research on GABA transmitter synthesis abnormalities [169].

Humanized AD animal models constructed by the stem cell transplantation technique described above have significant  advantages  over  3D  models.  Most  importantly, they provide longer latency to capture more critical AD neuropathological  features  including  astrocyte  proliferation, microglia proliferation, synaptic deficiency, dendritic degeneration, neuronal cytoskeleton abnormalities, progressive 4R tau expression, and tau hyperphosphorylation [16]. These advantages allow researchers to understand  the  relative  timing  of  the  appearance  of  different pathological  features  of  AD,  thus  providing  a  valuable platform for studying how aging causes or affects neurodegeneration (Fig. 2).

## Contributions of stem cell technology to AD research and treatment

Great progress has been made in iPSCs in neural differentiation in recent years, and there are now many protocols for  inducing  or  reprogramming  stem  cells  to  differentiate  into  different  types  of  cells  and  neurons  involved  in AD  pathogenesis,  such  as  neural  progenitor  cells  [9], microglia  [1],  astrocytes  [134],  oligodendrocytes  [138], endothelial  pericytes  [3],  glutamatergic,  aminobutyric

acidergic  neurons  [23,  41],  and  basal  forebrain  neurons [90], resulting in the possibility to create physiologically relevant  in  vitro  models  and  more  promising  means  of AD treatment.  In  the  following  sections,  the  value  and potential  of  stem  cells  and  their  derived  2D,  3D,  and humanized  animal  models  in  AD  mechanism  research, drug screening, and cell therapy are further explored.

## Stem cell-derived platforms for studying AD pathogenesis

With  the  rapid  development  and  application  of  the above-described stem cell-derived disease models, understanding  of  AD  has  improved.  The  emergence  of these new models has helped scientists study the pathological  mechanisms  of  AD  from  different  perspectives, such  as  'risk  genes' ,  'immunity' ,  and  'mitochondria' , and  propose  new  pathological  hypotheses  of  AD  while improving classic hypotheses.

## Amyloid hypothesis

In  1991,  John  Hardy  and  David  Alsop  proposed  the β-amyloid  cascade  hypothesis  [180],  which  suggested that  extracellular  β-amyloid  (Aβ)  in  the  cerebral  cortex is  the  central  component  of  brain  senile  plaques  in  AD patients  and  that  its  deposition  is  the  central  cause  of patient morbidity. Aβ is a short neurotoxic peptide produced by successive cleavage of APP by β-secretase and γ-secretase  enzymes  [115].  It  can  rapidly  aggregate  to form  oligomers  that  are  recognized  as  potent  synaptotoxins,  inducing  synaptic  loss  and  memory  impairment to  some  extent  [135].  In  contrast,  autosomal  dominant mutations in APP, presenilin-1 (PSEN1), and presenilin-2 (PSEN2) have been observed in patients with familial AD (fAD), and these mutations are responsible for the pathogenic aggregation of Aβ peptides into neuritis plaques [130]. Even without such mutations, similar pathological changes can be observed in sporadic AD (sAD). Thus, it is  presumed  that  insufficient  brain  Aβ  clearance  is  the key event leading to its aggregation [84].

Stem  cell-derived  disease  models  have  played  a  key role  in  the  formation  and  development  of  the  above hypothesis. In 2011, Yagi et al. established the first fADiPSC-derived neuron model carrying PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutations. These neurons were found to have increased Aβ42  secretion,  while PSEN fAD  mutations  impaired γ-secretase activity, thus confirming the pathogenic link between fAD and PS1 and PS2 mutations [149]. To further  identify  the  phenotypes  common  to  fAD,  [116] selected  cortical  neurons  produced  by  iPSCs  carrying different APP and/or PSEN1 mutations as a model. They found  that  endosomal  transport  defects  in  AD  were caused  by  APP  cleavage  by-product  β  C-terminal  fragment  (β-CTF),  as  shown  by  analysis  of  their  transcriptome  and  translatome.  This  finding  suggests  that  the pathological mechanism of AD is not limited to Aβ, and that future research should target other APP metabolites (such  as  β-CTF)  to  prevent  neurodegeneration  [116]. Using  this  disease  model,  future  research  could  also test whether endosomal changes are related to neuronal death  and  whether  blocking  the  accumulation  of  other APP  metabolites  such  as  β-CTF  can  prevent  neurodegeneration.  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  humanized  AD mouse models have also played a key role in evaluating the amyloid hypothesis [208].

In  addition  to  the  2D  models  described  above,  3D cell  culture  systems  and  humanized  AD  models  have been used to assess this hypothesis. Li et al. [190] constructed  a  3D  hydrogel  culture  system  and  observed many extracellular Aβ deposits in fAD ReN cells after 6 weeks of differentiation. Choi, Park, and Lee [171] established a 3D neurospheroid model consisting of prenatal rat (not human) cortical neurons and synthetic Aβ42 to test Aβ toxicity in a microfluidic platform [171]. In 2017, researchers generated a humanized AD model by transplanting  human  iPSC-derived  cortical  neurons  into  the brains  of  transgenic  Tg  (APP/PS1-21)  mice  [16].  In  the comparison of human and mouse neurons, it was found that the Aβ plaque morphology in human neuron clusters was more diffuse than the dense core plaques in mouse brains, further revealing the species-specific vulnerability of human neurons to AD pathology. This model has provided key insights for the development of the AD amyloid hypothesis.

## Hyperphosphorylation of tau protein

Given  the  failure  of  amyloid-based  therapies  for  AD, researchers' interest in tau has increased. Tau is a protein with roles in the stabilization and assembly of neuronal microtubules  (MAP)  that  is  mainly  expressed  in  neurons,  oligodendrocytes,  and  astrocytes  in  the  CNS  and peripheral  nervous  system  [127].  Tau  proteins  control microtubule  stability  through  heterodimerization  and phosphorylation.  Hyperphosphorylation  of  tau  leads  to abnormal function and aggregation, further forming neurofibrillary  tangles  (NFTs).  The  combination  of  toxicity acquired  by  aggregates  or  their  precursors  and  the  deleterious effects of loss of normal tau function in disease states may be an important cause of neurodegeneration [8].

Scientists  are  currently  attempting  to  use  stem  cellderived  pathological  models  to  address  an  important but unresolved question in AD: the relationship between tau  pathology  and  Aβ,  i.e.,  whether  tau  protein  aggregation  is  secondary  to  Aβ  deposition  or  an  independent  factor  directly  contributing  to  neurodegeneration. In  2012,  Israel  et  al.  [53]  reprogrammed  primary  fibroblasts  from  two  patients  with  fAD  and  found  that  tau

phosphorylation was increased in neurons carrying APP repeat  mutations  and  that  β-secretase  inhibitors  significantly  reduced  tau  phosphorylation  by  blocking  Aβ production [53].  Wang et al.  [137,  215,  216]  found  that the  elevated  level  of  hyperphosphorylated  tau  in  iPSCderived  neurons  carrying  apolipoprotein  E4  (APOE4) was not dependent on Aβ in APOE4 , paving the way for studies on other factors underlying tau phosphorylation. A  more  extensive  study  was  conducted  by  [121].  who performed  shRNA  knockdown  screening  of  more  than 50  AD  risk  genes  in  iPSC-derived  neurons  to  examine the effects on Aβ deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation and their interconnections. They found that FERM domain  containing  kindlin  2  (FERMT2)  expression  in neurons promoted late-onset AD (LOAD) formation and deterioration by increasing Aβ accumulation and tau levels [121].

Taken together, these findings demonstrate that human iPSC-derived neurons can effectively reflect the early features of AD pathogenesis, including the accumulation of pathogenic Aβ species and early tau disease. These results have  important  implications  for  further  research  and refinement of hypotheses and interrelationships between tau pathology and Aβ. Notably, both 3D culture models and  humanized  organoid  models  better  show  extracellular β-amyloid aggregation and NFT pathology than 2D neuronal cultures, providing a more robust model for AD research [121].

## Risk gene mutations

Genome-wide  association  studies  (GWAS)  have  identified  many  risk  genes  associated  with  different  types of  AD. Examples of these risk genes are summarized in Table 1.

Stem cell technology combined with gene editing techniques can shed light on the role of risk genes in AD and the interplay between environmental factors and genetic background. CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing and its derivatives have enabled efficient genetic modification of hiPSCs.  The  resulting  'homozygous  pairs'  have  greatly improved  the  resolution  of  disease-specific  phenotypes and  circumvented  the  need  to  collect  patient  cell  lines with  different  genetic  backgrounds,  thereby  facilitating research on the role of risk genes in AD [37].

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk site  for  LOAD  [25].It  also  plays  an  important  role  in maintaining  membrane  homeostasis,  supporting  synaptic integrity, and healing brain injury. In humans, APOE has three isoforms: APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4. [158] demonstrated  that  human  iPSC-derived  astrocytes  are a  powerful  platform  for  exploring  the  role  of  APOE  ε4 isoforms in AD. They found that, when co-cultured with iPSC-derived neurons, human iPSC-derived APOE ε4/ε4 astrocytes promoted neuronal survival and synaptogenesis, whereas APOE ε4/ε4 astrocytes were not as effective as astrocytes with the APOE ε3/ε3 genotype in supporting  these  neurotrophic  functions  [158].  Sienski  et  al. (2021) also used this platform to explore the relationship between lipid metabolism and APOEε4 mutations. They demonstrated that APOE4, but not APOE3, disrupts the lipidome of iPSC-derived astrocytes [113]. 3D brain organoids from AD patients have been used in related studies. Zhao et al. [223] found that brain organoids from AD patients carrying APOE ε4/ε4 showed greater apoptosis and  lower  synaptic  integrity  and  that  APOE4-related pathways were directly associated with pathological tau protein accumulation. CRISPR/Cas9 technology has also contributed greatly to research on APOE4. For example,

using  CRISPR/Cas9  and  gene  expression  analysis,  Lin et al. observed that the APOE4 variant affects a series of genes  that  regulate  lipid  metabolism  and  transport  and that  the  effect  is  cell-specific.  These  findings  provide  a reference for the design of future gene therapies targeting AD risk genes [68].

TREM2 ,  another  important  AD  risk  gene,  has  been extensively studied using stem cell-derived disease models. TREM2 encodes  the  myeloid  trigger  receptor  2, which is a cell surface transmembrane protein produced in the brain by microglia that primarily regulates microglial  cell  survival  and  activation  [75].  Mutations  in  this gene increase the chance of developing AD by 200-400% above  the  normal  level  [43,  61].  McQuade  et  al.  [195] analyzed  microglia  differentiated  in  CRISPR-modified TREM2  knockdown  iPSC  lines  [195].  By  combining multi-omics analysis with a chimeric AD mouse model, they found that TREM2 deletion reduced microglia survival,  impaired  phagocytosis of key substrates including APOE, and inhibited SDF-1α/CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis, ultimately leading to impaired uptake of β-amyloid plaques  in  vivo.  By  combining  chronic  demyelination paradigms  and  cell  sorting  with  RNA  sequencing  and lipidomics, Nugent et al. [200] elucidated the causal link between abnormal cholesterol transport and metabolism in  TREM2-deficient  microglia  and  the  accumulation  of toxic proteins in the brain, confirming that TREM2 deficiency exacerbates AD pathology.

In summary, stem cell technology can also be used to conduct GWAS. The genomes of iPSCs are more stable and  reflect  the  genetic  information  of  individuals  more realistically than the traditional cell lines used in GWAS research. Furthermore, since iPSCs can differentiate into various cell types associated with AD, they can better  mimic  GWAS-related  diseases.  CRISPR-based  gene editing  technology  can  introduce  knockouts  or  singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNPs)-targeted mutations into iPSCs, thus providing a high-throughput platform to functionally validate AD-related SNPs and genes [46].

## Abnormal mitochondrial structure and function

There  is  growing  evidence  that  impaired  mitochondrial biogenesis  and  function  are  involved  in  many  neurodegenerative diseases and can impair synaptic neurotransmission, which is essential for normal cognitive function. As  a  neurodegenerative  disease  [114],  aging  is  a  major risk factor for AD. However, the reprogramming step of iPSC  technology  resets  age-related  features  (e.g.,  mitochondrial  dysfunction,  telomere  shortening,  etc.)  back to the fetal stage, [74], meaning that stem cell models are useful for not only studying disease mechanisms but also disease processes-especially early biological and pathological  events  that  disrupt  neurological  maintenance.

Stem  cells  and  their  derived  models  thus  provide  a highly exploitable platform to study structural-functional changes in mitochondria early in AD development. They can also help us better understand the molecular basis of mitochondrial  heterogeneity  in  structure  and  function. Stem  cells  with  normal  or  abnormal  mitochondria  can be generated from healthy people and patients and then differentiated  into  various  cell  lineages.  This  approach allows  us  to  investigate  how  the  state  of  mitochondria affects  stem  cells'  ability  to  generate  different  cell  types and  regulate  remodeling  in  disease-specific  cells.  As proof  of  concept,  we  can  use  patient-derived  stem  cell platforms to investigate the role of mitochondria in AD development. This approach represents a paradigm shift in  understanding  the  role  of  mitochondria  in  human disease and opens up new avenues for AD research and therapy.

Using  stem  cell-derived  models,  many  studies  have shown that  mitochondrial  dysfunction,  including  metabolic disorders, increased ROS production, altered mitochondrial  morphology,  and  dysregulation  of  mitochondrial  quality  control  (QC)  [211,  218],  are  early signs  of  AD  progression  and  contribute  to  disease  progression.  GWAS have identified variants in the ABCA7 gene encoding ATP-binding cassette (ABC) subfamily A member 7 that are strong risk factors for late-onset AD [183].  By  constructing  ABCA7-deficient  iPSC-derived cortical organoids, Kawatani et al. proposed a new mechanism of AD-related neuronal injury caused by ABCA7 function  loss:  ABCA7  deficiency  interferes  with  mitochondrial lipid metabolism, damages mitochondrial respiration, produces excessive ROS, enlarges mitochondrial morphology,  and  leads  to  disruption  of  mitochondrial homeostasis  and  synaptic  function  of  neurons  [188]. Mitochondrial QC includes fission and fusion processes, mitochondrial trafficking, and  mitophagy  [214].  The constant  change  of  mitochondrial  structure  and  shape through continuous fusion and fission is a process called mitochondrial  dynamics  [165].  There  is  growing  evidence  that  dysfunction  of  mitochondrial  dynamics  may be the pathological cause of delayed onset neurodegenerative diseases such as AD [165]. When the contents and organelles  of  mitochondria  are  damaged,  mitochondrial autophagy  is  triggered.[191].  Mitochondrial  autophagy is a process that selectively removes damaged mitochondria,  plays  an  essential  role  in  regulating  the  number of  intracellular  mitochondria  and  maintaining  normal mitochondrial function [161]. In the early course of AD, Fang  et  al.  [178]  observed  widespread  impaired  mitochondrial  autophagy  in  iPSC  human  AD  neurons.[178] To  investigate  the  effect  of  APP  cleavage  products  on mitochondria  function,  Lee  et  al.  (2022)  used  induced neural  stem  cells  (iNSC)  derived  from  fibroblasts  of  an

AD patient  origin  as  a  model.  They  concluded  that  the accumulation of APP-derived C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) within the structural domain of mitochondria may be responsible for dysfunction such as impaired mitochondrial autophagy [64]. Martin-Maestro et al. [80] observed  that  dysfunctional  mitochondria  accumulated due to impaired mitochondrial autophagy in skin fibroblast iPSC-derived neurons carrying fAD -associated mutations.  They  further  determined  that  the  defective autophagic process was caused by a reduced autophagic degradation  phase  due  to  lysosomal  abnormalities  [80]. They  also  constructed  hiPSC-derived  NSCs  carrying the  fAD-associated  PS1  M146L  mutation  and  identified mitochondrial respiratory chain defects, such as low expression levels of key enzymes like cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV), cytochrome c reductase (complex III), fusion proteins like mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), and autophagy-associated proteins light chain 3  (LC3) . Reduced  expression  of  lysosomal  associated membrane protein 1  (LAMP1) and transcription  factor EB (TFEB) may further contribute to the accumulation of defective mitochondria. These findings suggest that early metabolic  alterations  and  impaired  mitochondrial  QC may have consequences for the pathophysiology of AD.

Because  autopsy  does  not  provide  relevant  information  about  disease  progression,  it  is  critical  to  develop model  systems  to  study  early  molecular  changes.  AD human  iPSC-derived  models  are  thus  complementary tools  to  study  the  degenerative  process.  Researchers have used such models to demonstrate the critical role of early events like mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired mitochondrial autophagy on AD  pathogenesis [81]. Besides  DNA  in  nuclei,  cDNA  mutations  in  mitochondria  are  another  potentially  important  cause  of  AD,  as well as the root of aging, and thus deserve our attention [222].  Researchers  should  focus  on  mitochondria  signal pathways and mitochondria-targeted therapy to improve obstacle stress and energy metabolism in AD, ultimately improving our understanding of the interaction between genetic  and  environmental  factors  that  contribute  to mitochondria dysfunction in AD.

## Immune system disorders

There is an intricate link between the immune system and CNS; when this balance is broken, it can cause neuroinflammation  and,  ultimately,  AD.  Neuroinflammation  is an inflammatory response in the CNS caused by various pathological injuries. In this process, CNS glial cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, produce various pro-inflammatory  cytokines,  such  as  Interleukin-1β  (IL-1β),  IL-6, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and chemokines, as well  as  small  molecule  messengers  and  reactive  oxygen species [31]. CNS glial cells thus play an important role in the progression of inflammation.

Stem  cell  technology  allows  researchers  to  study  the interplay between immune function and AD using models like co-culture of immune cells from a single patient with  their  organoids  [82].  As  stem  cell-derived  3D  cultures  can  generate  human  oligodendrocyte  spheroids, astrocyte  spheroids,  and  neurons,  these  models  can  be applied to investigate glial cell functional abnormalities, different glial cell interactions, neuronal interaction networks,  and  the  mechanisms  of  AD  immune  disorders. Bianco et al. [10] used a microfluidic platform to investigate  the  complex  roles  of  different  regional  astrocytes in  neuroinflammation.  They  inoculated  astrocytes  from the  cortex  and  hippocampus,  as  well  as  primary  hippocampal neuron cell types, from rat embryos in different chambers of the microfluidic network. By examining the effects on neuronal viability in two neuroinflammatory  injury  models  (i.e.,  metabolic  stress  and  exposure to  amyloid  β  protofibrils),  they  clarified  the  differential contributions  of  brain  region-specific  neuroglia  in  two in  vitro  models.  This  study  reflects  the  superiority  of 3D microfluidic  organ  chips  with  multiple  chambers  to independently control culture conditions and selectively differentiate stem cells into different cell types with different stimuli. As this is also an open-ended method, it allows  close  monitoring  of  the  specific  contribution  of each cell type by analyzing morphology, viability, calcium kinetic, and electrophysiological parameters when different chambers are micro fluidically connected [10]. Such models can reveal the complexity of cell-cell interactions in  neuroinflammation, which is of great importance for elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved. To study the  effect  of  the  immune  system  on  neuronal  signaling, Guttikonda et al. [44] established a well-defined human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC)-derived tri-culture system containing pure populations of hPSC-derived microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. Using this culture system, they were able to demonstrate that increased complement C3 production in the brain is partly caused by microglia activation and its interaction with astrocytes, which in turn worsens neuroinflammation [44].

Synthetic  models  with  AD  features  have  also  been developed. For example, Park et al. [95] used this technique  to  create  a  human  ternary  culture  model  containing  NPC-derived  neurons  and  astrocytes  as  well  as immortalized  human  microglia.  This  method  reflected the  phenomena  of  microglia  recruitment,  neurotoxic activity,  and  nitrogen  monoxide (NO) release damaging AD  neurons  and  astrocytes  and  is  suitable  for  further investigating the complex molecular mechanisms of neuroinflammation that underlie AD pathology [95]. Human pluripotent stem cell-derived brain-like Organoids

co-cultured with immune cells from AD patients can also be used to better understand inter-glial interactions and provide  an  ideal  experimental  platform  to  explore  the mechanisms of AD immune dysfunction under an in vivo growth environment.

As a proof of concept, we can use patient-derived stem cell platforms to study the role of the immune system and various glial cell communication disorders in the development of AD. This represents a paradigm shift in understanding  the  role  of  immunity  in  human  disease  and opens new avenues for AD research and treatment. In the future, new models could be developed to evaluate novel therapeutical interventions for AD such as immunomodulatory therapy, anti-inflammatory drugs, and immunoglobulin therapy.

In  summary,  reprogramming  somatic  cells  from  AD patients  back  to  stem  cells  that  can  be  re-differentiated into in vitro disease models to probe disease progression and  pathogenesis  provides  a  new  approach  for  understanding  the  pathogenesis  of  human  neurodegenerative  diseases.  This  approach  also  takes  advantage  of  the reverse engineering platform to monitor and determine key  pathogenetic  events  during  disease  development. The hallmark of degeneration of the aging brain is selective  cell  vulnerability  in  disease-specific  patterns  many decades after the birth of long-lived brain cells. The traditional  paradigm  for  investigating  neurodegeneration has  been  to  define  the  biological  processes  and  pathways mediating brain cell dysfunction and death during the adult life; neurodegenerative diseases have thus been considered  a  discrete  pathological  entity  rather  than  a continuum  of  a  common  pathogenic  process.  The  new perspective  considers  neurodegenerative  diseases  as  a fundamental  disorder  of  neural  development  in  which subtle impairment in the regional programming of neural  development  results  in  selective  neural  and  brain network vulnerability to a spectrum of late-life stressors. Indeed, emerging data support the possibility of pathogenic associations between abnormalities in the birth and death of vulnerable brain cell subtypes [210].

## Development of stem cell technology platforms for drug screening

Good disease models can be used to explore the diverse pathogenesis of diseases and support drug screening and development. However, drugs to stop AD progression are currently lacking. One important reason for this is that current  drug  screening  methods  typically  rely  on  holistic animal models and cell lines as pharmacological and toxicological testing systems. Animal models of AD have species  differences  and  cannot  fully  represent  human responses, while most human cell lines are immortalized tumor cell lines that hardly reflect the reactivity of normal human cells.

Alternatively, in vitro differentiation of stem cells as a model  of  normal  human  development  can  be  used  for drug screening or to obtain multiple normal somatic cell types  to  test  the  toxicological  effects  of  drugs  on  specific  cells.  The  use  of  iPSC  in  vitro  differentiated  cells to  screen  new  drugs  can  greatly  reduce  the  number  of experimental  animals  required  for  drug  experiments. The  use  of  stem  cells  to  establish  models  that  comprehensively reflect the pathological phenotype and disease mechanisms of  human  AD  is  thus  of  great  significance for AD drug development and screening.

In 2017, Kondo et al. presented a platform for drug discovery  and  development  using  human  iPSCs  and  compound screening. They used 13 iPSC-differentiated pure cortical neurons from AD patients. After two rounds of screening,  the  final  screen  q  yielded  six  potential  compounds that could minimize Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels. Such models can help overcome the drawbacks encountered in drug development and screening using standard human iPSC platforms [56, 123].

Simple models of iPSC-derived neurons have failed to account  for  interactions  with  vascular  cells,  glial  cells, and  the  blood-brain  barrier  (BBB).  The  BBB  is  a  major factor  limiting  the  action  of  AD  drugs.  Moreover,  BBB dysfunction  and  catabolism  have  been  observed  in  AD, which in turn triggers a series of inflammatory responses and neuronal loss and neurodegeneration. The development of specific AD BBB models and their application in preclinical  studies  are  therefore  important  for  improving  the  success  of  AD  drug  clinical  trials.  Many  recent studies  have  reported  successfully  applying  combined iPSC and microfluidic  technology  to  mimic  the  BBB  in a  neuro-neuroglial  interaction  model  [132].  The  use  of iPSC-derived BBB models in combination with gene editing  (e.g.,  CRISPR/Cas-9  technology)  to  mimic  diseaseassociated  mutations  or  introduce  artificial  mutations (e.g.,  gene  knockout)  can  better  reflect  altered  brain dynamics  in  disease  states  and  help  screen  new  drugs that  can  reach  deeper  neural  tissues  through  the  BBB [4, 112]. Gene-edited iPSCs expanded and differentiated in vitro into different cell types can also be transplanted into  AD  animal  models  to  generate  human-animal  chimeras for drug screening [136, 142].

## Potential of stem cell-based therapies for AD

In addition to their value as disease models and for drug screening, stem cells have played a significant role in treating  AD.  The  transplantation  of  stem  cells  to  treat  AD  is mainly  based  on  their  ability  to  differentiate  into  neurons and glial cells that can replace damaged cells, release

cytokines to activate endogenous neurogenesis, and regulate  immune cell status. Transplanted stem cells also can be induced to differentiate into glial cells or corresponding precursor cells to improve the neuronal environment by  repairing  the  functions  of  supporting  cells,  ultimately repairing overall neural network  function.  Stem  cells can also act therapeutically through the contents of their secretomes, e.g. exosomes. Unlike monoclonal antibodies or enzyme inhibitors that target Aβ to slow down the pathological  process,  stem  cells  have  the  potential  to  rebuild the  integrity  of  the  CNS.  Moreover,  given  the  interconnectedness  of  the  various  mechanisms  of  AD  pathology, targeting just one for treatment may not be as effective as therapies  targeting  various  factors-stem  cells  have  the potential to treat AD via multiple mechanisms (Fig. 3).

## Stem cell transplantation therapy

The  formation  of  Aβ  and  its  damage  to  the  neurological  system  is  one  of  the  best  known  pathological  processes  in  AD  [141].  Clearing  Aβ  from  the  brain  is  thus thought  to  be  one  of  the  most  promising  ways  to  treat AD.  Stem  cell  transplantation  could  reduce  Aβ  deposition  through  the  following  mechanisms:  activation  of microglia to eliminate Aβ through specific phagocytosis [62,  63],  regulation  of  the  expression  levels  of  enzymes related to Aβ synthesis or degradation (e.g., upregulation of  α-secretase  activity  or  downregulation  of  γ-secretase or  β-secretase activity) [224], or removal of existing Aβ deposits  through  immunotherapy.  These  effects  on  Aβ could  occur  separately  or  simultaneously  [189].  The clearance of Aβ is frequently accompanied by microglia,

Fig. 3 The role of stem cell-based therapies in the treatment of AD. A Through direct transplantation, retransplantation following differentiation into neural cells, and secretory exosome infusion, stem cells offer various benefits for treating AD. B Stem cells with their differentiated cells and derived exosomes regulate the release of a range of cytokines, reducing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and increasing levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), IL-10) in cerebrospinal fluid. C The phenotypes of microglia and astrocytes are changed by stem cells through their differentiated cells and exosomes, shifting them from a pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory phenotype and decreasing the inflammatory response in the brain and promoting neuroactivity. D Stem cells with their differentiated cells and derived exosomes are upregulated with Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), etc. The stem cells transplanted through exogenous pathways are integrated into the neural network to regenerate synapses. E As MSCs with their differentiated cells and exosomes activate microglia, they specifically phagocytose Aβ or regulate the expression levels of Aβ-related enzymes (e.g., upregulate α-secretase activity or downregulate β-secretase activity) to clear existing Aβ deposits

however, this does not mean that microglia activation is essential for stem cell transplantation therapy to achieve Aβ clearance [144].

Hyperphosphorylation of tau protein and NFT production are also significant pathological aspects of AD, and different tau structures may mediate different pathogenic processes.  However,  more  extensive  research  on  how stem  cells  can  improve  tau  pathology  is  required  [36, 38]. Nevertheless, it is important to investigate potential improvement in tau pathology by stem cell therapy given the current assumption that tau pathology may develop independently  of  Aβ  pathology.  There  is  adequate  evidence  that  stem  cell  transplantation  can  improve  the activity of cells damaged by abnormal tau protein neurotoxicity. For example, Zilka et al. [226] co-cultured AT tau cells,  a  model  of  AD  cells  developed from human truncated  tau  protein  (Tau151-391,  4R),  with  mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and found that this greatly enhanced cell  viability,  demonstrating  that  MSC  therapy  rescued cells  from  toxic  tau  protein.  The  researchers  suggested that this effect of MSCs is partly attributed to the complex bioactive components in their secretomes. They also reported that MSCs encouraged neurite development in cells  expressing  truncated  tau.  These  findings  demonstrate that stem cell therapy can reduce cellular damage caused by toxic tau proteins-at least in in vitro experiments [226]. However, the therapeutic effect of stem cell transplantation  on  tau-oligomers-burdened  models  still needs to be explored, for tau oligomers is now observed to cause serious synapse elimination [212].

One  of  the  most  significant  therapeutic  functions  of stem cells in neurodegenerative disorders is replacement of  senescent,  damaged  neurons.  When  stem  cells  like iPSC-NPCs are pre-induced in vitro to differentiate into cholinergic  neurons  and  then  reimplanted  they  could improve memory and cognitive function. They have been proven to survive and differentiate  into  cholinergic  and GABAergic neurons when directly transplanted to lesion sites. The positive effects of stem cells on synaptic regeneration  can  be  described  as  endogenous  or  exogenous: exogenous synaptic regeneration is realized through the integration of stem cells implanted into neural networks, whereas  endogenous  synaptic  regeneration  is  realized through  the  promotion  of  synaptic  regeneration  via upregulation of factors positively associated with neurogenesis, e.g., BDNF, NGF, etc.

Many experiments have demonstrated enhancement of synaptic integrity and elevation of neuronal activity after injection of stem cells, and Basal forebrain-like cholinergic  neurons  (BFCN)  progenitor  cells  are  frequently  utilized in experiments [184, 221], indicating the possibility of rebuilding neuronal circuits utilizing exogenous neural stem cells.

As an alternative to exogenous implantation, numerous studies have sought to achieve brain repair by promoting the expression of endogenous growth factors and, subsequently, repairing neuronal circuits. In many studies, the upregulation  of  proteins  associated  with  antioxidation, synaptic connectivity, and neurogenesis such as sirtuin1 (Sirt1), BDNF, synuclein (SYN), and β-nerve growth factor  (β-NGF),  has  been  observed.  [157,  172,  175]  Stem cells'  secretomes  or  the  trophic  factors  produced  after their  differentiation  into  glial  cells  also  act  as  sources of  neurotrophic  factors.  For  instance,  using  co-culture experiments, Peng et al. [203] showed that BM-MSCs can differentiate into Schwann cells and promote the quantity and  length  of  sprouting  neurons  of  dorsal  root  ganglia neurons.

However, other studies suggest that the delivery of neurotrophic factors is not the primary benefit of stem cells for  treating  neurodegenerative  illnesses  [34].  Although delivery  of  neurotrophic  factors  may  appear  to  be  less effective  at  rescuing  neurodegeneration,  this  technique can  be  utilized  to  enhance  the  therapeutic  efficacy  of stem cell transplantation.

For example, using BDNF-transfected MSCs for transplantation,  Song  et  al.  [117]  showed  that  the  neuroprotective effect of BDNF increased the activity and synaptic integrity of primary cultured neurons in APP/PS1 mice. The  transplanted  BDNF-MSCs  differentiated  into  neuronal  cells,  increased  the  number  of  local  cholinergic neurons,  promoted  Acetylcholine  (Ach)  secretion,  and improved  cognitive  function  [117]. Overall, synaptic regeneration may be more effectively promoted by combining  the  secretion  of  neurotrophic  factors  with  the exogenous replacement of neurons.

Given increasing emphasis and support for the 'infection  theory'  of  AD,  neuroinflammation  mitigation  has become an innovative treatment approach [51, 85], and the modulatory effects of stem cell infusion therapies on immunological function in the CNS are becoming focal areas.

As  one  of  the  most  common  immune  cell  types  in the  CNS,  microglia  maintain  and  protect  neural  cells by  controlling  inflammation  and  preserving  the  integrity  of  the  microenvironment,  among  other  methods [166]. In AD, related gene expression in certain microglia  changes during the course of the disease [83], the expression of these genes in certain microglia has been shown  to  rescue  neurodegeneration  [61].  Thus,  altering microglia activity is considered a potential method for treating AD. In APP/PS1 mice treated with human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells  (hUCB-MSCs),  [63]  demonstrated  an  increase in  microglia  in  the  alternative  activation  state  and  a decrease in neuroinflammation. In addition, Yokokawa

[220] showed that MSCs transplantation into the brains of  APdE9 mice induced microglia to convert from the M1  phenotype  to  the  M2  phenotype  and  engage  in phagocytosis,  while  also  reducing  neuroinflammation and enhancing the redox state. Besides, the transition between different microglia phenotypes, lower expression  of  pro-inflammatory  factors  (TNF-,  IL-6,  and Monocyte  chemoattractant  protein-1  (MCP-1))  and decreases  in  the  quantity  and  volume  of  microglia  in the cortex have been observed in stem cell transplantation studies [197].

Rather than a one-way influence, there is mutual action between neural stem cells and microglia [207]. Thus, the efficacy of stem cell transplantation is likely to be influenced by the microglia's state of activation. In support of this, a study by Popova et al. [204] showed that microglia could induce transcriptional changes in neural stem cells and  reduce  interferon  signaling  response  genes,  while interferon-induced  transmembrane  protein  3  (IFITM3) was  previously  shown  to  upregulate  γ-secretase  activity to increase Aβ production. By co-culturing activated microglia with NPC, Lilienberg et al. [67] demonstrated that  naïve  microglia  do  not  affect  the  proliferation  of NPCs  and  enhanced  neurosynaptic  growth.  Using  this co-culture  system,  the  authors  also  observed  that  the nitro  blebbistatin-triggered  synaptic  development  was enhanced  by  naïve  microglia.  [67].  Popova  et  al.  [204] showed that microglia can induce transcriptional changes in neural stem cells and accelerate the emergence of synchronized oscillatory network activity in brain organoids, which has implications for the integration  of  stem  cells into  the  original  neural  network  following  transplantation. These findings have revealed the potential of using drug  induction  in  stem  cell  therapy  and  the  important effect  the  environment's  microglia  status  has  on  neural stem  cells.  More  importantly,  not  all  instances  of  activated  microglia  cause  damage  to  neurons.  Thus,  preregulating  the  state  of  microglia  in  the  environment  or combining it with drug induction may need to be considered when designing stem cell transplantation therapies.

In  terms  of  other  parts  of  the  immunoregulation  system is the CNS, the glymphatic system, which is related to  various  diseases  like  Parkinson's  [122],  diabetes  [55], hypertension [89], and aging [57], has recently attracted attention  for  its  role  in  brain  homeostasis.  The  glymphatic  system  controls  the  clearance  of  various  toxic compounds  that  develop  with  aging  or  other  changes from  the  brain,  including  Aβ  proteins  linked  to  AD. Astrocytes play a significant role in the glymphatic system, such as removing waste proteins by regulating cerebrospinal  fluid  shunting  via  aquaporin-4  (AQP-4).  A promising approach to treating AD thus involves altering astrocyte activity through stem cell transplantation.

Previous  studies  have  reported  that  stem  cells  can inhibit the proliferation of astrocytes and encourage the development of non-reactive astrocytes, which have the capacity  to  support  synaptic  regeneration,  heal  injured neurons,  and  engage  in  phagocytosis  and  Aβ  catabolism [6]. Because abnormal cerebrospinal fluid-mediated immune  function  has  significant  implications  for  AD pathology and stem cell transplantation has been shown to  improve  some  causes  of  glymphatic  system  disorders-including upregulation of aquaporin (AQP-4) expression  and  attenuation  of  astrocyte  proliferationthe  beneficial  effects  of  stem  cells  on  the  lymphoid-like system warrant further investigation [97, 143]. One novel avenue for future stem cell research in AD may be stem cell manipulation of astrocyte protein expression, which in turn influences the effectiveness of material exchange and waste clearance in the lymphoid system.

In  summary,  stem  cell  transplantation  therapy  has been shown to not only improve typical pathology indicators of AD, such as Aβ and Tau fiber tangles, but also to  have  a  reciprocal  modulatory  effect  on  numerous important immune system cell types, including microglia and astrocytes. These various efficacies most likely work together  to  achieve  the  neuronal  regeneration  and  cognitive improvement observed after transplantation. Preconditioning  the  microenvironment  of  the  treated  area or combining neural stem cells with certain glial precursor cells (GPCs) may be a workable therapeutic approach when considering the interactions between cells and their environments.

## Stem cell-derived glial cell therapy and models

Although  neurons  may  be  directly  responsible  for  cognitive  function,  their  sustained  activity  relies  largely  on support from glial cells, which account for the majority of  brain  cell  populations.  The  repeated  failures  of  strategies  to  eliminate  abnormal  protein  aggregates  in  AD patients-such as Aβ aggregation inhibitors, Aβ antigens, anti-Aβ  monoclonal/polyclonal  antibodies,  γ-secretase inhibitors,  γ-secretase  modulators,  and  β-site  amyloid precursor  protein  cleaving  enzyme  (BACE)  inhibitorsmay teach us a lesson: although glial cells have long been ignored, they make important contributions to the onset and progression of AD.

Glial cells are now widely recognized to have potential for AD research and therapy. Using disease models based on glial cells, it is possible to investigate AD pathogenesis in a more systemic way. With rapid developments in stem cell technology, more attention is being paid to glial cell transplantation  therapies.  The  three  major  approaches to  transplanting  glial  cells  derived  from  stem  cells  are microglia transplantation, astrocyte transplantation, and  oligodendrocyte  transplantation.  NSCs,  GPCs,  and

pluripotent  stem  cells  (PSCs)  are  some  sources  of  stem cells  used  for  glial  cell  transplantation.  GPCs  can  also be obtained from PSCs. Given the potential of stem cellderived neuroglia platforms and therapies, it is necessary to  discuss  possible  approaches  to  glia-based  platforms and transplantation therapy.

Stem  cell-derived  glia  in  disease  modeling Given  the important role of glial cells in maintaining a stable brain environment  and  neuronal  health,  it  is  necessary  to involve multiple glial cell types in the construction of disease models. Accordingly, glial cell-based models of AD need to be developed using different glia types to establish in vitro and in vivo models. Such models will enable researchers to study AD in a more controlled and systemic manner to identify novel treatments.

Many studies using AD disease models containing glial cells  have  provided  new  understandings  of  pathological processes. Complement C3 is a protein that is increased under inflammatory conditions and implicated in synaptic loss. Guttikonda et al. [44] identified the main reason for increased C3 in AD and the main cell types involved being  microglia  versus  astrocytes  using  a  hPSC-derived microglia  and  tri-culture  system  model  [44].  By  using neurons, astrocytes,  and  microglia  in  a  3D  microfluidic platform, Park et al. [95]. presented a 3D human AD triculture  model  that  mirrors  microglial  recruitment  and important neurotoxic activities in AD [95].

To  summarize,  to  deepen  our  understanding  of  AD pathogenesis  and  promote  AD  therapy,  more  research is needed to help design glia-based AD models that mirror typical activity in AD. A tri-culture system comprising all three kinds of neuroglia may be a more promising approach than using a single glial cell type. This suggests that human brain organoids comprising neurons and several types of glial cells should be an ideal platform for AD research. However, additional studies about the different glia subtypes are warranted, since the subtypes have different  functions  and  may  thus  have  different  effects  on AD pathology.

Stem cell-derived glia  in  AD  therapy Traditional  brain cell  therapies  tend  to  use  ectogenic  neurons  to  replace damaged ones. However, this type of transplantation has numerous drawbacks, many of which are caused by neurons' ability to be excited. In some cases, neuron transplantation can cause convulsion in mice, which can eventually lead to death. Ectogenic neurons are thought to be responsible for these severe side effect because they are more excitable [105]. Further research is clearly needed to explore additional cell types for cell replacement therapies for  AD.  Glial  cells,  including  microglia,  astrocytes,  and oligodendrocytes,  play  crucial  roles  in  maintaining  the environment in the human brain and regulating processes over the lifecycle of neurons. Glial cells are now considered  a  promising  choice  because  they  positively  influence neurons in many ways, including secretion of factors,  phagocytosis, and direct interaction between cells. Glial cells are also comparatively safe for transplantation because  they  are  non-excitable,  thereby  protecting  the recipient from hypo-excitation.

## Microglia transplantation for AD

Due  to  their  ability  to  activate  and  escalate  neuroinflammatory responses, microglia have long been considered one of the main contributors to damage caused by neuroinflammation.  However,  based  on  in-depth  studies  on  microglia  function  and  state,  current  microglia therapies  no  longer  advocate  comprehensive  suppression  of  their  functions,  but  rather  distinct  strategies  to promote  alleviation  of  neuroinflammation  that  are  tailored  to  the  microenvironment  of  the  specific  disease. Due to the extended longevity of microglia and the fact that  the  gradual  loss  of  homeostasis  is  associated  with AD pathogenesis, the low efficiency of nascent microglia in removing aggregates of toxic proteins may encourage the pathological processes of AD. To restore their natural  immunological  filtering  function,  senescent  microglia should be rejuvenated or healthy microglia could be replenished  endogenously  or  exogenously  as  part  of  an AD treatment strategy. Exogenous microglia supplementation or stem cell-derived microglia transplantation are potential approaches to reestablish central immune clearance. In bone marrow transplantation (BMT), microglialike cells produced from iPSCs, ESCs, or monocytes are the main cell sources for microglia transplantation. Several  studies  have  reported  successful  transplantation  of microglia  into  the  mouse  brain  and  validation  of  functional integration of microglia after transplantation [145, 145, 147, 147]. Notably, the microglia showed oligodendrocyte  phagocytic  and  synaptic  phagocytic  functions characteristic of normal microglia. Microglia transplanted  into  mice  brains  are  stimulated  by  Aβ  to  alter expression groups, i.e., gene expression that tends to be in an activated state [76]. However, proof of their mitigating  effects  on  AD  pathology  is  limited.  It  has  also  been shown that TREM2 expression is lower in hPSC-derived microglia  [32].  Given  that  low  TREM2  expression  was thought to have a positive effect on maintaining microglia  homeostasis,  human  pluripotent  stem  cell-derived microglia  may  help  maintain  a  stable  phenotype  that  is beneficial to remission of neuroinflammation after transplantation into the brain.

Although  there  is  insufficient  research  on  microglia transplantation  to  treat  AD  pathogenesis,  transplanting

microglia could theoretically help reduce harmful protein buildup from  pre-existing,  hard-to-remove  senescent microglia and help carry out typical synaptic pruning and oligodendrocyte phagocytosis. Transplantation of a single  microglia type (or equivalent precursor cell, such as a primitive macrophage progenitor cell (PMP) might not result in significant changes in AD pathology; transplantation  combining several stem cell types might be preferable. Depending on the lesion location, the appropriate subtype  of  microglia  can  be  selected  and  paired  with astrocytes or neural stem cells to more accurately reflect the environment that supports neurons in vivo.

## Astrocyte transplantation

The  properties  and  activities  of  astrocytes  are  altered in many neurological illnesses, including AD, which may worsen the degenerative processes. It is well established that astrocytes can be generated from stem cells or histocytes. Transplanting astrocytes to achieve recovery of functions is regarded as one of the most promising directions for AD treatment.

At present, astrocyte transplantation therapy uses human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiated astrocytes, human  iPSC  differentiated astrocytes,  human fetal  brain-derived  astrocytes,  or  human  fetal  spinal cord-derived  astrocytes.  The  best  source  of  astrocytes is  currently  differentiation  using  stem  cells  (e.g.,  iPSCs, hESCs),  as  it  is  difficult  to  achieve  the  quantity  needed for transplantation therapy using astrocytes derived from the human fetal spinal cord and human fetal brain, which is crucial for efficacy [157].

The feasibility of transplanting astrocytes requires integration of glial cells into existing circuits. This was demonstrated  by  Zhang  et  al.  [224]  in  their  study  showing that NSC-derived glial precursor cells could differentiate into astrocytes and integrate into existing circuits in the brain after transplantation, with a survival time of more than one year. Initially proposed to treat spinal cord damage, astrocyte transplantation has been proven to protect host spinal cord neurons, encourage axonal regeneration, reduce  glutamate  toxicity,  and  support  restoration  of motor, sensory, and respiratory functions [160].

The  neurotrophic  effects  of  astrocytes,  microglia activation, and oligodendrocyte activation all support astrocyte  transplantation  for  treating  AD.  Although there are only a few  studies using  astrocytes for AD  therapy,  the  existing  research  provides  preliminary  proof  that  intracerebral  transplanted  astrocytes undergo  morphological  changes  in  response  to  Aβ deposition  and  that  this  morphology  varies  with  AD stage [101]. It has also been demonstrated that human

ESC-derived astrocytes stimulate the IL-4 signaling  cascade  by  controlling  the  microglia  phenotype and  serving  as  neuroprotectants,  which  is  consistent  with  previous  findings  on  the  clearance  of  Aβ  by astroglia [98, 136, 142]. As demonstrated by increased AQP4  polarization  facilitating  deposit  clearance  and improved  neuronal  function  [151],  implantation  of GPC-derived  astrocytes  was  recently  shown  to  result in long-term functional integration and sensory enhancement in elderly mice.

In addition to astrocyte transplantation alone, astrocyte transplantation has been proposed in combination with neuronal transplantation. Because astrocytes facilitate  neuronal  maturation  and  increase  synaptic  plasticity, combined cellular therapies may be advantageous for both maintaining astrocyte function and promoting neuronal differentiation [160].

## Oligodendrocyte transplantation

Oligodendrocytes  are  the  core  cell  type  involved  in myelination.  They  can  be  differentiated  from  oligodendrocyte  precursor  cells  (OPC)  capable  of  migration,  expansion,  and  protecting  axons  and  neurons. The degenerative process in AD frequently involves oligodendrocyte dysfunction, which can result in further neuronal  loss  and  dysfunction.  OPC  transplantation has mainly been investigated for treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, its potential for AD treatment should  not  be  disregarded  since  OPCs  play  a  crucial role  in  remyelination  by  producing  new  oligodendrocytes to replace damaged ones and recovering lost cells after  injury.  Additionally,  the  biphasic  communication of  OPCs  with  astrocytes  makes  their  function  closely related  to  that  of  the  central  immune  system.  Theoretically,  OPCs  can  be  transplanted  alone  to  promote myelination and supporting axons, or transplanted with neurons to repair loss of functional cells in the brain.

Oligodendrocyte transplantation is less  common and  is  typically  intended  to  heal  neurological  impairment rather  than  to  treat  AD.  For  example,  Windrem et  al.  [217]  transplanted  human  glial  precursor  cells (hGPCs)  for  differentiation  into  oligodendrocytes  and observed myelin repair in the brain of myelin-deficient shiverer mice; the researchers thought the cells would subsequently  function  as  remyelinating  oligodendrocytes  and  be  normally  recruited.  This  study  proves that  integration  of  transplanted  GPCs  differentiated into oligodendrocytes in the brain is possible. Notably, OPC transplantation may be a more durable approach to external regeneration of oligodendrocytes due to the potential of GPCs to differentiate into other glial cells.

## Stem cell-derived exosome therapy

Although  stem  cell  therapy  has  shown  superiority  over traditional drug therapy for AD, it still faces many problems. First, since stem cells have a low degree of differentiation  and  strong  ability  to  divide,  they  are  prone  to tumors. Second, intranasal administration is  often  used to administer drugs to the brain, but is challenging with stem cells.  Using  MSCs (with a diameter of 30-60 μm) as an example, the large size of stem cells may block the pulmonary capillaries and induce immune rejection [87]. Thus,  delivering  transplanted  stem  cells  to  the  brain  is challenging  and  carries  some  risk  [27,  96].  Autologous transplantation  of  MSCs  is  challenging  in  patients  with fulminant  disease  due  to  the  complex  cell  preparation process and time needed for cell transplantation [48].

Exosomes  derived  from  stem  cells  have  become  a promising  new  cell-free  strategy  in  the  decades-long pursuit to improve the therapeutic efficacy of stem cells. Exosomes, as a part of stem cell secretomes, are diverse membrane-bound  vesicles that function as intercellular  messengers.  They  carry  different  loads  including DNA,  RNA,  proteins,  and  lipids,  among  others.  Stem cell-derived  exosomes  show  molecular  specificity  due to  engineering  and  drug  accumulation  and  can  induce potent action mediated by the activation of factors and molecules with variable concentrations and signaling cascades. These actions can be easily modified and enriched by engineering exosomes [24].

The  physiological  roles  of  extracellular  vesicles  (EVs), which are abundant in most body fluids and released by cells. In fact, transplanted stem cells function in the body mainly due to their paracrine effect. As important parts of the stem cell secretion group, the physiological functions of exosomes are similar to those of their stem cell counterparts [153].

Compared  with  stem  cell  transplantation,  exosome therapy has low immunogenicity and a lower likelihood of forming tumors. Nanoparticles (NPs) between 10 and 1000  nm  in  size  can  encapsulate  therapeutic  molecules by targeting the transport process in the CNS and then effectively  migrate  to  target  organs  after  infusion  without blocking pulmonary capillaries and causing immune rejection. Cell-secreted exosomes, which are lipid-membraned  vesicles,  can  easily  permeate  the  BBB  to  exert their  physiological  effects.  Exosome  therapy  has  also shown advantages for AD patients with acute onset.

Because  stem  cell-derived  exosomes  generally  show comparable  biological  activity  as  stem  cells  and  have many  advantages,  they  have  become  a  hot  topic  along with cell  therapy  in  the  treatment  of  neurodegenerative diseases-exosomes are believed  to  be  able  to  clear  Aβ protein in the brain, restore synaptic activity in the brain, reduce  inflammatory  responses  in  the  brain,  enhance neural network connectivity, and alter metabolism. They thus have great potential for treating a variety of diseases including AD.

Researchers in Taiwan [22] Chen, et al. recently established a mouse FAD model and showed that the level of Aβ in mouse cells after  exosome  treatment  was  significantly reduced. In this experiment, exosome therapy was also  found  to  improve  glucose  metabolism  in  the  brain and restore the protein-modifying enzyme histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), representing improvement in memory and cognitive function.

Some  researchers  have  improved  exosomes'  efficacy at  reducing  Aβ  in  the  brain  through  combination  with other  drugs.  [140]  used  BM-MSC-derived  exosomes  in combination  with  sphingosine  kinase  inhibitor  (SKIII) or sphingosine-1-phosphate-1 receptor blocker (VPC23019).  They  found  that  exosomes  inhibited  Aβ140,  Aβ1-42,  BACE1,  and  PS1  in  AD  mouse  cortex  and hippocampus,  thereby  improving  spatial  learning  and memory.

Some studies have found that stem cell-derived exosomes have therapeutic effects on neurological function [73]. A proteomic analysis of brain tissue from AD mice  treated  with  MSC-EVs  showed  that  a  variety  of proteins  in  EVs  exert  neuroprotective,  synaptic  growth, and  neurogenesis  effects.  In  the  above  study,  EVs  were also found to have therapeutic effects on some risk genes that  can  cause  AD.  Compared  with  the  control  group, 1094 genes were upregulated and 267 genes were downregulated in the brains of AD mice after exosome treatment. Some of these upregulated genes-such as piccolo (PCLO), TENM1 ,  and  Neurite  extension  and  migration factor ( NEXMIF )-are positive for synaptic function and memory improvement, while some downregulated genes are associated with cell death, such as BAD . These results suggest  that  EVs  can  relieve  nerve  damage  and  significantly increase neurogenesis in AD mice.

Regarding  inhibition  of  inflammation  in  the  brain, controlling  M1/M2  phenotypic  switching  of  microglia is  significant  for  treatment  of  AD.  Exosomes  derived from MSCs can convert from the M1 phenotype with a pro-inflammatory effect into the M2 phenotype with an anti-inflammatory  effect,  which  can  effectively  reduce neuroinflammation and relieve AD symptoms [30, 71, 96, 119].

Many  previous  studies  have  used  AD  mouse  models to prove the effect of exosomes on inhibiting inflammation. However, due to differences in molecular pathways and  signaling  functions  between  rodents  and  human microglia, a research group from Stanford University [40] chose to study the role of MSC-EVs in the human microglial  cell  line  (HMC3).  They  showed  that  EV  treatment reduced the expression of CD11b in cells and the number

of proteolysis and exerted an anti-inflammatory effect by promoting  M2  phenotypic  transformation  of  microglia. Notably, these results are similar to findings in AD mice.

Recent  studies have shown  that  stem  cell-derived exosomes can act on astrocytes to reduce their activation, thereby reducing neuroinflammation and improving cognitive impairment in AD patients. The most intuitive use of stem cell-derived exosomes on astrocytes is to reduce the proportion of active astrocytes, which is manifested as  reduced  glial  fibrillary  acidic  protein  (GFAP)  levels in  the  brain  and  colocalization  of  GFAP  and  amyloid plaques [22] [24, 137, 215, 216])

Some  findings  for  stem  cell-derived  exosomes  in  AD therapy over the last five years are listed below (Table 2):

## Challenges and strategies for stem cell technology in AD research and treatment (Fig. 4).

## Limitations and strategies of using stem cells in disease modeling and drug screening

Although  human  iPSCs  have  become  a  powerful  tool for  human  disease  modeling  and  have  great  potential for  translational  research  in  target  discovery  and  drug development,  various  challenges  remain.  Human  iPSCderived neurons are sensitive and require extended culture time (80 days) to develop mature neuronal features; it is challenging to do this consistently and at a large scale by manually changing the culture medium [111]. Several strategies exist to overcome these challenges. Notch and γ-secretase  inhibitors  have  been  shown  to  shorten  the maturation  period  of  most  neuronal  cell  types  [13,  20]. Another approach includes overexpression of neuro-specific genes. For example, overexpression of Ngn2 accelerates the generation of forebrain and motor neuron cells to within 10 days [52, 56]. In addition to shortening the time,  the  use  of  a  high-throughput  screening  platform for  aged  neurons  may  be  more  translatable.  Although scientists  have  differentiated  stem  cells  into  neurons, these  neurons  are  functionally  immature-similar  to embryonic or early postnatal neurons. The limited maturity  of  neurons  obtained  using  stem  cell  culture  techniques diminishes their potential for neurodegeneration research. However, recent studies have found that differentiating human iPSCs into motor and cortical neurons and then culturing them on synthetic nanofiber coatings with  high  internal  supramolecular  motion  can  enrich them into more mature neurons [2]. Furthermore, since sAD is influenced not only by risk genes but also epigenetics,  aging  and  environmental  factors  may  contribute to  its  development. The ability of iPSC models to accurately  mimic  the  sAD  phenotype  is  another  challenge in  disease  modeling  and  is  thought  to  be  an  important reason why numerous AD therapies effective in preclinical trials have poor clinical outcomes [33]. The development of more effective sAD models is thus an important goal for the future.

Compared  to  2D  culture  systems,  3D  culture  platforms  are  better  suited  to  study  AD  pathophysiological mechanisms  involving  cell-cell  interactions,  controlled flow dynamics, circulating blood cells, and brain-specific microenvironments  [100].  However,  they  still  cannot mimic the intrinsic immune rejection reactions encountered  in  practical  clinical  applications.  There  are  also many  technical  challenges  facing  organoid  culture  and microfluidic technology. For example, human brain organoids lack the vasculature of brain tissue in vivo, which plays  a  facilitating  role  for  both  nutritional  supply  and neuronal cell differentiation. This lack of vascularity leads to  necrosis  in  brain-like  organ  centers,  further  interfering  with  normal  development  and  neuronal  migration routes. Although co-culture with vascular stem cells provides  a  partial  solution  to  these  problems,  the  issues  of nutrient  supply  and  the  true  blood  microenvironment remain. hESCs expressing human ETS variant 2 (ETV2) have  been  used  to  successfully  construct  brain  cortical organoids (hCOs) with vascular-like structures, including tight  junctions,  increased  expression  of  nutrient  transport  proteins,  and  transendothelial  resistance,  thereby addressing  the  challenge  of  missing  blood  vessels  [17]. However, further development is needed for their application in neurodegenerative disease. Regarding microfluidic technology, the requirements for reagent volume and reaction conditions are so stringent that small changes in the volume of reaction components can lead to changes in  the  results  [118].  Therefore,  the  clinical  usefulness  of this method needs to be further explored.

For drug screening, it is extremely important to select the appropriate early-onset predominant phenotype as a marker to measure the effect of the tested drug. In AD, the dominance of tau hyperphosphorylation or Aβ aberrant  deposition  phenotypes  has  still  not  been  elucidated.  As  a  result,  extensive  mechanistic  studies  are needed  before  applying  the  findings  to  drug  screening [21]. Since neurons, astrocytes, and microglia are highly specialized and disease-relevant cell types, the long time required  for  their  differentiation  limits  the  application of iPSC-derived glial cells in disease modeling and drug screening.  The  discovery  of  novel  strategies  to  promote gliogenesis is thus crucial for large-scale drug screening. Novel gene editing tools and biomolecular technologies, such  as  single-cell  RNA  sequencing,  could  also  enable more  accurate  disease  modeling  and  drug  screening processes.

To  summarize,  stem  cells  are  widely  used  in  disease modeling,  drug  screening,  and  cell  therapy  because  of

Fig. 4 Examples of current challenges for stem cell-based AD therapies and strategies for improvement. A Bare stem cell transplantation results in challenges such as disruption of cell membranes and apoptosis. B Delivery after encapsulation with a protective organic framework protects stem cells from oxidative damage and mechanical damage. C Stem cell transplantation therapy may have limited efficacy due to low differentiation efficiency. D Co-culture of certain biomolecules with stem cells can enhance stem cell differentiation. E The efficiency of migration and localization of stem cells in the body after transplantation is difficult to guarantee. F Regulating the expression of specific genes can promote targeted migration of stem cells. G Traditional 2D culture methods may result in reduced or even lost differentiation potential of stem cells over time. H Beneficial characteristics, such as differentiation potential, can be better retained by using a 3D culture strategy. I Poor production of stem cell-derived exosomes.

their  unlimited  self-renewal  ability  and  potential  to  differentiate  into  all  cell  types.  By  using  stem  cell-based platforms, AD research can better study the fundamental  biological  mechanisms  of  the  disease,  develop  new technologies,  and  innovate  on  therapeutic  concepts.  In the future, interdisciplinary collaborations should be fostered to build organoids or assemble spheroids and other multicellular models of human tissues comprising diverse cell types (e.g., excitatory/inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia). This could enable rapid testing  of  genetic,  chemical,  and  environmental  perturbations  to  develop  genetic  engineering  and  genome editing tools to study the pathogenesis and treatment of the disease and develop in vivo models that more accurately  recapitulate  human  physiology.  We  must  develop multi-omics technologies, such as single cell and spatial transcriptomics,  long  read  sequencing,  next-generation proteomics,  and  other  high-throughput  cellular  phenotyping platforms. We also need to develop software, data mining,  and  machine  learning  methods  to  dissect  biological  complexity  in  aging  and  disease  and  to  perform functional and genomic analyses of multicellular models (e.g.,  bulk  or  single  cell  transcriptomic  characterization, live  cell  imaging,  and  electrophysiology)  and  chemical biology-enabled  multi-omics  or  chemical  library-based drug screening studies.

## Limitations and strategies of stem cells and derived therapies

AD research that uses stem cell technology faces several significant  challenges.  These  include:  (1)  limited  capacity  for  self-renewal  and  differentiation  of  stem  cells,  (2) heterogeneity of stem cell populations and their derived cell types, and (3) ethical concerns surrounding the use of embryonic stem cells. However, ongoing efforts to overcome  these  limitations  hold  great  promise  for  improving the quality and  effectiveness of  stem  cell-based approaches. These efforts include: (1) the development of new techniques to promote differentiation,  (2)  preventing  pre-mature  death  of  stem  cells  and  improving  the therapeutic effect, and (3) investigating alternative, ethically  acceptable  sources  of  stem  cells.  Further  research and innovation will therefore be critical to realize the full potential of stem cell technology in the fight against AD. The development and implementation of new strategies will  improve  the  quality  and  utility  of  stem  cell-based platforms for AD research and therapy, ultimately leading to better outcomes for patients with AD and related dementias.

## Limitations of current stem cell therapies

Limited capacity for self-renewal and differentiation The ability of stem cells to differentiate into specific cell types that carry out corresponding functions is frequently what determines how effective they are. As a result, inadequate differentiation  rates  or  unexpected  differentiation  can significantly  impede  therapy.  In  certain  cases,  uncontrolled  stem  cell  differentiation  can  potentially  result  in the development of tumors [12]. For these reasons, many studies using stem cells for therapeutic purposes pre-differentiate stem cells such as iPSCs into certain progenitor cells before transplantation [126]. Another factor that negatively affects stem cell therapy is the loss of beneficial properties that occur during processes such as culturing, including the differentiation potential of stem cells. The loss of these beneficial properties is partly due to traditional  culture  systems  that  do  not  accurately  reflect  the natural environment of the body. In response to this limitation, many studies aim to maximize the original properties of stem cells through methods like 3D culture or the addition of specific small molecules.

Large-scale  clinical  translation  is  also  thought  to  be hampered  by  stem  cells'  capacity  for  in  vitro  amplification.  Since  stem  cells  have  a  unique  ability  to  differentiate,  it  is  essential  that  they  maintain  their  original characteristics  during  expansion.  However,  at  present, additional generations of expansion are more suitable for small-scale  operations  in  laboratories  than  large-scale clinical applications.

Heterogeneity  of  stem  cell  populations  and  their  derived cell types Other important factors affecting the efficacy of stem cells is heterogeneity [60] and derived cell types. Stem  cell  heterogeneity  is  universal,for  example,  NSCs contain  different  cell  populations  with  both  neurogenic and  gliogenic  potential  [58].  MSCs  are  inherently  heterogeneous  cell  populations,  although  the  International Society for Cellular Therapy has clear restrictions on the types and proportions of molecules expressed on their cell surfaces. Explicit quantification of differentiation capacity and cell surface molecular expression serves to reduce the possible impact of stem cell heterogeneity on efficacy. It is  well  known that stem cells derived from different tissue sources can differ in the number and type of cytokines secreted, cell proliferation capacity, immunomodulatory capacity, etc. [39, 72, 120]. Stem cell heterogeneity is also related  to  tumorigenic  potential.  Notably,  some  studies have  observed  sustained  proliferation  and  tumorigenic mass production after transplantation of hPSC neuronal derivatives in rodent models of PD [106, 107]. Stem cell heterogeneity must thus be accounted for in AD therapy research. [156] concluded that the ideal stem cell therapy for  AD would transplant cells with different differentiation potentials precisely to the corresponding functional sites to achieve overall restoration of the functional network of the brain, which relies heavily on the identifica-

tion and isolation of stem cell heterogeneity. [156] Besides stem cell heterogeneity, the heterogeneity of their derived cell types can greatly affect efficacy. For example, MSCs derived from healthy controls and patients can exhibit differences in  certain  functions.  There  are  also  unresolved questions whether MSCs of the same tissue origin have different epigenetic imprints. While current research on stem  cells  and  heterogeneity  of  origin  has  focused  on tumor therapy, we believe it is also valuable to consider this  issue  in  the  context  of  neural  stem  cell  use  for  AD therapy. First, identifying and isolating subpopulations of neural stem cells in different states or with different differentiation potentials can both help determine the precise efficacy of specific subpopulations of stem cells and provide more possibilities for precise AD treatment. Second, emphasis  on  stem  cell  source  heterogeneity  could  lead to better quality control of stem cells used for treatment, which in turn will provide assurance of efficacy.

Ethical and safety concerns surrounding the use of embryonic  stem  cells  and  cerebral  organoids Ethical  issues have been widely discussed along with the development of stem cell technology, most of which are regarding the sources  of  stem  cells.  In  the  development  of  therapies using  hESCs,  the  rationale  of  destroying  early  human embryos to treat diseases is controversial. Other current ethical issues concern the unlimited differentiation potential  of  iPSCs,  which  might  be  used  for  human  cloning and thus the generation of human-animal chimeras and human embryos [133]. It is worth noting that human-animal chimeras are one of the most promising research platforms for AD pathology research. However, these models have been ethically questioned due to their similarity to the human brain. The crucial question is: does this technology have the potential to produce a human-like mind? Although the likelihood of human brain-like organs generating  consciousness  is  currently  considered  minimal, we  cannot  exclude  the  possibility  of  future  brain-like organs  developing  consciousness.  To  better  understand AD pathology, we will likely need to develop more complex,  organ-like  models  that  more  accurately  reflect  the human brain. [108] concluded that although there is currently no chance that cerebral organoids may develop typical consciousness, questions surrounding the presence or absence of consciousness may plague the development of brain-like organs. We thus need more precise protocols for the production, use, and destruction of different levels of organoids that consider ethical norms and safety.

At  present,  the  primary  source  of  ESCs  is  human embryos  (blastocysts),  which  has  limited  the  development of derivative therapies and poses considerable difficulties for clinical applications because of the difficulty of mass production. Although it seems promising to use iPSCs as an alternative source of ESCs, there are safety concerns  because  of  the  genomic  instability  of  iPSCseven  with  improved  protocols  for  differentiation.  As  a result, before transplantation, many studies first promote in  vitro  differentiation  into  progenitor  cells  of  specific neuronal types. The use of iPSC-derived gametes has also raised concerns about the potential exploitation of developed  embryos,  human  nuclear  transfer,  and  the  risk  of altering natural reproduction, including the potential to derive gametes for same-sex and asexual reproduction.

## Strategies to overcome existing limitations and improve the quality of stem cell-based therapy and platforms

Several  studies  have  sought  to  overcome  the  current limitations  and  improve  the  quality  of  stem  cell-based therapies and platforms through methods like the development  of  new  stem  cell  lines  and  new  direct  differentiation  methods.  The  success  of  new  encapsulation techniques, stem cell pretreatment, and co-delivery with small  compounds  also  provides  inspiration  for  further stem cell research.

Development of new techniques to promote differentiation

## Co-administration of small molecules to promote differentiation

The process of differentiation in vivo , which is thought to play a significant role in efficacy, occurs in a variety of stem  cell  therapies,  regardless  of  whether  the  cells  are anticipated to differentiate into the target neuronal type in vivo or are infused after initial differentiation in vitro. The  recent  discovery  that  chiral  small  molecules  promote stem cell differentiation in vivo has provided a new idea for improving the efficacy of stem cell therapy: coadministration  of  small  molecules  that  encourage  stem cell  differentiation  [110].  Observed  that,  when  exposed to  near-infrared  light,  nanoparticles  with  strong  chirality can significantly speed up the differentiation of mouse NSCs  into  neurons.  This  finding  suggests  that  strong chiral nanomaterials may be utilized to direct cell development and improve differentiation to achieve better efficacy in stem cell therapy. The use of near-infrared light might  also  lead  to  better  control  of  the  pro-differentiation effect [110].

Furthermore,  [104]  demonstrated  that  nanoparticle assemblies  exerted  circularly  polarized  light-dependent forces  on  the  cytoskeleton  and  that  light-induced  periodic  mechanical  deformation  of  actin  nanofibers  at  a frequency  of  50  Hz  stimulated  neural  stem  cell  differentiation  into  a  neuronal  phenotype.  When  implanted in the hippocampus of a mouse AD model, neural stem cells irradiated according to a polarity-optimized scheme substantially reduced the formation of amyloid plaques.

These  findings  provide  novel  ideas  for  improving  the efficacy  of  stem  cells  and  a  reference  for  the  biological effects of circularly polarized light. Muñoz et al. [90] developed a differentiation scheme that successfully generated  basal  forebrain-like  cholinergic  neurons  (BFCN) from iPSCs using small molecule inhibitors and growth factors.  The  study  used  LDN193189  and  TGF-β  inhibitors  SB431542,  FGF-2,  SHH,  FGF-8,  BDNF,  and  NGF (separately or in combination) at different stages of differentiation  to  achieve  a  facilitative  effect  on  the  differentiation of iPSCs to BFCNs. These results also indicate that the strategy of adding small molecule inhibitors and growth factors at different periods has a regulatory effect on  stem  cell  differentiation,  providing  theoretical  support for promoting the differentiation of stem cells after transplantation.  Since  this  experiment  was  conducted in vitro, further research is needed to determine whether the  effects  extend  to  intracerebral  transplantation.  We cannot  rule  out  the  possibility  that  the  aforementioned differentiation-promoting  small  molecules  could  have unintended effects on the brain [90].

## Pretreatment of stem cells

Since stem cells are sensitive to environmental changes, pretreatment is one of the most efficient strategies to change their phenotype and improve therapeutic efficiency. Stem cell transplantation can influence the number or type of surface receptors of certain types of somatic  cells,  enzyme  expression  levels,  and  secretome composition and have other effects that influence therapeutic efficacy by modifying environmental factors. Alternatively, small molecules can be added to the cell coculture medium. It has been demonstrated that cytokines (such as IL-3, IL-6, HGF, etc.) increase the expression of CXCR4,  which  in  turn  encourages  targeted  migration of  MSCs.  Hypoxic  preconditioning  is  another  method frequently  used  to  change  the  culture  environment. In  a  study  by  [146],  culture  under  hypoxic  conditions induced  an  increase  in  SDF-1/CXCR4  signaling,  which promoted MSCs migration. Similarly, [65] observed that hypoxia-induced  MSCs  had  better  viability, stronger proliferation  potential,  and  better  resistance  to  hypoxia and  reactive  oxygen  species  (ROS)  stress.  The  proliferation and viability of neural stem cells have also been shown to be enhanced by hypoxia culture [15], which is a  proven  way  to  improve  the  survival  rate  of  stem  cells after transplantation.

Since transplanted neural stem cells must differentiate  to  be  therapeutic,  it  is  necessary  to  promote their  differentiation  at  the  lesion  site.  A  study  by  [86] demonstrated that, after melatonin treatment with neurosphere  culture,  an  inhibitory  effect  on  NSC  proliferation  at  a  pharmacological  concentration  (25  μM) was observed: differentiation  of  NSCs  into  neurons-as well as oligodendrocytes-was  promoted,  while differentiation  of  NSCs  into  GFAP-expressing  astrocytes was  unaffected.  Melatonin  also  enhanced  the  bioenergetic  activity  of  mitochondria  in  NSCs  and  exhibited  a dose-dependent  pattern,  suggesting  that  this  stimulation method provides energetically pertinent support for the differentiation process. Melatonin therapy thus promotes NSC differentiation and neural replacement using NSCs combining pharmacological melatonin dosages is a potential  regenerative  therapy  for  neurological  diseases. Studies  on  chemically  created  self-assembling  peptides have  also  been  performed  to  encourage  NSC  differentiation.  [26]  established  a  self-assembling peptide (DSP) that  can  spontaneously  assemble  into  ordered  nanofibers  and  contains  a  functional  structural  domain  made of  the  laminin-derived  amino  acids  Tyr-Ile-Gly-Ser-Arg (YIGSR); not only did this peptide increase cell viability in  normal  culture  conditions,  it  also  lowered  the  number of apoptotic cells induced by Aβ in vitro. NSC transplantation in AD rats treated with DSP was observed to enhance  survival  and  neuronal  differentiation  of  transplanted  NSCs;  increase  secretion  of  anti-inflammatory and  neurotrophic  factors  such  as  IL-10,  brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF),  and  insulin-like  growth  factor  1  (IGF-1);  and reduce increased expression of pro-inflammatory factors such  as  TNF-α  and  IL-1β.  These  experimental  findings are  consistent  with  the  hypothesis  that  the  biomaterial DSP ameliorates AD pathophysiology by promoting NSC graft survival and development.

Brn-4  protein  in  MSCs  also  plays  a  positive  role  in treatment  of  AD,  but  miR-937  in  stem  cells  hinders translation  of  Brn-4.  Thus,  administration  of  specially pretreated  anti-miR-937  MSCs  can  contribute  to  the reduction and clearance of brain Aβ deposition [69].

## 3D culture of stem cells

Improving stem cell culture methods is another potential  strategy  to  improve  efficacy.  Traditional  in  vitro  2D culture  conditions  may  result  in  loss  of  stemness  and other  favorable  qualities,  as  2D  culture  mitigation  does not  accurately  represent  the  ecological  niche  of  stem cells  in  vivo.  Supporting  cells,  extracellular  matrix,  and growth factors make up the microenvironment inhabited by stem cells in vivo. In contrast, 3D culture can better simulate  intercellular  and  cell-matrix  interactions.  The natural environment of stem cells can be more accurately recreated in 3D culture and their favorable qualities can be maintained. Thus, one of the most promising methods currently being examined to support clinical translation of  stem  cells  is  3D  cultivation  technologies.  For  example,  Frith,  Thomson, and Genever (2010) performed 3D culture of MSCs and demonstrated that dynamic 3D culture promoted MSCs to form aggregates with good cell

viability. This effect was attributed to the combination of 3D culture with dynamic factors like increased cell-cell contact, which has been shown to improve stem cell subdifferentiation potential. Similarly, [139] designed culture substrates with micropatterns to culture MSC multicellular  spheroids  in  3D  culture,  finding  that  this  method maintained  cell  function  and  improved  differentiation potential in the longer term.

In  conclusion,  as  3D  culture  can  better  mimic  the microenvironment of stem cells in vivo and help maintain  stemness,  it  is  of  great  value  for  advancing  clinical translation of stem cell therapies.

## Preventing premature death of stem cells and improving therapeutic effects Encapsulation of stem cells

Many encapsulation approaches are designed to improve  the  low  survival  rate  and  prevent  premature death  of  stem  cells.  Hydrogel  encapsulation  followed by  medication  administration  is  a  common  technique. Hydrogel materials are biocompatible, can be safely dissolved and absorbed in vivo, can remain stem cells aggregated and increase cell viability [92, 93]. Since MSCs have superior  healing  and  anti-inflammatory  potential  when aggregated  into  spheres  for  administration,  aggregation of stem cells may support efficacy [92, 93]. Multiple studies have shown that encapsulation with hydrogel materials improves the survival as well as the function of stem cells [49, 91].

However,  after  drug  delivery,  the  volume  of  hydrogel  molecules  may  restrict  molecule  diffusion.  This  was recently addressed by a single-cell encapsulation scheme using alginate microgels designed by [79] in which MSCs were  encapsulated  in  a  thin  layer  of  alginate  material using  a  microfluidic  approach  to  form  microgels.  The reduced  size  of  the  encapsulated  material  allowed  for improved diffusive drug transport. This method can enable  intravenous  drug  delivery.  The  half-life  of  encapsulated cells is also considerably longer than that of naked cells.

As  early  as  2016,  studies  have  shown  that  hydrogelencapsulated  stem  cells  can  be  used  to  treat  AD  mice. Other materials like DSP (a self-assembled peptide) can promote  neuroprotection  and  exert  anti-neuroinflammation  and  paracrine  effects  by  increasing  the  survival rate  and  differentiation  ratio  of  transplanted  stem  cells, thereby maximizing the therapeutic effect of NSC transplantation for AD [26].

The  potential  for  widespread  application  or  commercialization of such technology is enhanced by the fact that encapsulants can be preserved using normal cryopreservation techniques and defrosted cells have similar persistence of to freshly encapsulated cells after removing the encapsulants. [155] established a novel hydrogen-bonded

(HOFs)  encapsulation  technique  for  NSCs  in  organic frameworks. They concluded that the main causes of the suboptimal  efficiency  of  transplantation  are  'stemness' loss, cell membrane damage during transplantation, and apoptosis  induced  by  oxidative  stress  after  transplantation. This study was the first to encapsulate NSCs using HOFs  and  showed  that  this  method  can  improve  NSC viability,  encourage  neurogenesis,  and  reduce  cognitive damage. Protective encapsulation of stem cells may be a viable means to prevent loss during transplantation and guarantee efficiency. [154] established a delivery strategy for  encapsulated  NSC  drugs  that  integrates  antioxidant nanoenzymes (e.g., ceria) into metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).  This  method  combines  the  antioxidant  capacity  of  nanoenzymes  with  the  effective  drug  delivery  of MOFs, resulting in lower oxidative damage to stem cells while the reactive framework releases encapsulated stem cells in the lesion area. Targeted delivery with a reactive framework  while  loading  enzymes  to  prevent  oxidative damage is instructive as a delivery route.

MOFs  have  also  recently  attracted  attention  due  to their  potential  in  developing  new  AD  diagnostic  methods.  MOFs  are  assessed  by  fluorescence  and  electrochemiluminescence  (ECL)  detection  of  AD  biomarkers. Fluorescence detection of major metal ions in the brain (Zn 2 + ,   Cu 2 + ,   Fe 3 + , and   Al 3 + ) can be performed as part of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [124].

In  summary,  encapsulation  methods  and  their  modifications appear to be viable and adaptable strategies to achieve  targeted  release  of  stem  cells  and  increase  the survival  rate.  The  reactive  design  of  the  encapsulating framework  enables  targeted  release  of  stem  cells,  while the varying loads (enzymes, etc.) provide the potential to withstand  oxidative  damage.  What  is  currently  needed is to adjust the size of the formed package carriers (e.g., to  form  microgels)  with  reference  to  existing  studies  to create  an  encapsulating  vehicle  that  is  appropriate  for intravenous drug delivery while avoiding issues like vascular  blockage.  The  optimum  method  of  encapsulation should enable post-thaw use in addition to conventional cryopreservation.

## Regulation of gene expression in stem cells

A commonly used method to alter cellular phenotypes is  the  introduction of genes encoding specific products. At present,  many studies use viruses as vectors for this process. For stem cell therapy for neurological diseases, a  promising  option  is  to  upregulate  gene  expression  to help  localize  post-transplanted  stem  cells  to  the  lesion sire.  [152]  demonstrated  in  vitro  that  overexpression  of Wnt3a promoted  the  migration  and  neural  differentiation of MSCs through the Wnt/PCP pathway. Although in vivo experiments are needed to demonstrate whether upregulating  expression  of  this  pathway  has  the  same

effect,  this  method  has  the  potential  to  promote  MSC migration to achieve better efficacy. [152]

Investigation  of  alternative,  ethically-acceptable  sources of stem cells At present, the main sources of stem cells can be grouped into four categories: embryonic tissue, fetal tissue, specific locations in adult organisms, and differentiated somatic cells after being genetically reprogrammed [7]. A significant proportion of these sources involve the destruction of embryos or fetuses, which has historically been a source of ethical controversy in stem cell therapy. Of these, only morula-derived ESCs are totipotent, i.e., can differentiate into all cell types in an organism. In contrast, stem cells from fetuses are generally pluripotent and can differentiate into a limited number of specific cell types. To circumvent the ethical issues of extracting stem cells, iPSCs seem to be a promising source of stem cells. However, there is the issue of overcoming possible immune rejection caused by allogeneic transplantation. Using a patient's own somatic cells as a source of stem cells would result in an increased time cost and is not suitable for large-scale clinical application. Currently,  adipose-derived  stem  cells  (ASCs)  are  one  of the best choices for stem cell therapy and tissue engineering due to their easy accessibility and proliferative capacity relative to BM-MSCs. In the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, ASCs have been observed to outperform various other stem cells in the secretion of trophic factors such as  BDNF. Therefore, adipose tissue appears to be a good source of stem cells for stem cell-based therapy considering ease of access, ethical issues, and overall efficacy.

Overcoming  the  current  limitations  of  stem  cell  technology is crucial for the advancement of AD research and treatment.  The  improvement  and  implementation  of  new strategies will enhance the quality and utility of stem cellbased platforms for AD research and therapy, leading to better outcomes for patients with AD and related dementias.

## Limitations and strategies of stem cell-derived exosome therapy

Despite the great potential of exosome-based therapies, many difficulties must still be overcome to translate these therapies into clinical practice. First, traditional EV production processes based on pricey 2D cell culture protocols require a lot of cell culture plastic, media, and space. Furthermore,  as  exosomes  are  secretory  products  of cells,  their  yield  is  low  and  they  are  difficult  to  produce on an industrial scale. Another significant obstacle is how to  accurately  identify  exosomes  from  other  extracellular  vesicles  (EVs),  particularly  functional  microvesicles. The techniques that aim to address these challenges are described in the following section [29].

## Increasing exosome secretion

3D  culture Traditional  2D  culture  techniques  are  less efficient  in  terms  of  space,  material,  and  yield.  In  contrast,  3D  culture  offers  healthier  culture  conditions  and has  the  potential  to  produce  higher  EV  secretion  rates. MSC-EVs from conventional 2D monolayer cell cultures, 3D suspended droplet spheroids, and 3D aggregates were compared by Harrel et al. [48]. Their results showed that EV secretion was three-fold higher using 3D culture compared  to  2D  culture.  Thus,  an  effective  way  to  improve exosome production is by 3D culture.

A recent study that treated AD mice with 3D-MSCEVs found that when 6E10 antibodies were used as the criterion to assess Aβ density, there was no significant difference  in  intracellular  levels  of  HPCs  between  the control  group  and  3D-MSC-EV  group;  however,  the levels  of  some  inflammatory  markers  in  mice's  brains were significantly reduced and behavioral experiments yielded positive results [24].

Chemical  molecular  interference Inducing  metabolic changes  and  other  disruptions  in  cells  through  the administration  of  chemical  molecules  can  also  impact exosome generation. By blocking both oxidative phosphorylation  and  glycolysis,  sodium  iodoacetate  (IAA) and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) were shown to effectively reduce the cellular energy charge. Exosome production can also be increased using chemicals like chloroquine, lipocalin (APN), and NH4Cl [24].

Environmental  factors According  to  previous  studies [54,  148],  exosomes  can  be  promoted  by  hypoxia,  pH changes, and low glucose levels. EV secretion was slightly enhanced  after  moderate  hypoxic  treatment  of  MSCs (0.5-1%  oxygen),  while  no  increase  in  exosome  release was  observed  when  MSCs  were  stimulated  with  5% hypoxia, although the nature of the exosomes was altered. Many researchers are interested in acidity as a potential way to control exosome generation. A recent study demonstrated that the environmental factors of excessive acid and alkali resulted in decreased exosome formation compared to normal pH levels [24].

Studies  have  also  shown  that  MSCs  in  a  hypoxic state present stronger activity, while oxygen-rich environments  lead  to  lower  stage  viability  of  MSCs.  [69] administered  hypoxic-conditioned  MSC-derived  miR21-riched  exosomes  to  APP/PS1  mice.  Their  results showed that hypoxia-treated MSCs had obvious activity,  while  upregulation  of  miR-21  enhanced  memory and reduced Aβ plaque deposition. [69]

## Improvement in separation methods

Exosomes, which are a part of stem cell secretomes that differs  from  microvesicles  and  apoptotic  vesicles,  occur through  direct  germination  of  the  plasma  membrane, whose biogenesis starts with inward growth of the plasma membrane to create early endosomes. These endosomes then mature into multivesicular bodies (MVBs), including  inward  germination  through  the  endosomal  membrane, to create intraluminal vesicles (ILVs).

The  emerging  role  of  exosomes  in  AD  research  and therapy  has  created  the  need  for  their  large-scale  isolation. However, this is costly and difficult using conventional  methods  like  ultra-centrifugation.  Ultrafiltration-based exosome separation is a good substitute for  conventional  ultracentrifugation  because  it  involves a  shorter  processing  time  and  requires  no  specialized equipment. Additionally, by varying the size of the filter, ultrafiltration  enables  separation  and  collection  of  tiny extracellular vesicles of a certain particle size, including exosomes.  Tangential  flow  filtration  is  another  efficient method  to  eliminate  vesicle  blockage  caused  by  ultrafiltration  in  combination  with  pretreatment  with  protease, resulting in decreased viscosity of the fluid sample. Microfluidic devices are ideal tools for exosome separation and are beginning to achieve acceptance as superior exosome detection tools. These compact platforms make it  possible  to  process  nanovesicles  quickly  and  affordably-even in small quantities of liquid samples.

A  different  technique  for  separating  exosomes  while maintaining the biological activity of isolated exosomes is volumetric exclusion (SEC). Unlike ultra-ionization  and ultrafiltration,  SEC  is  achieved  by  passive  gravity  flow with  no  effects  on  vesicle  structure  and  integrity.  High resolution  and  repeatability  are  additional  benefits  of SEC [150, 219].

## Conclusions and future directions

This  review  provides  a  comprehensive  overview  of  the latest research advancements in stem cell-derived models for AD and discusses the fundamental mechanisms and applications of stem cells and their derived therapies for mitigating  AD  pathology.  Stem  cell  technology  is  helpful  for  the  discovery  of  such  mechanisms  and  potential therapeutic  options,  including  cell  transplantation  and generating exosomes for disease treatment.

Our  understanding  of  the  pathogenic  mechanisms of  AD  has  improved  with  ongoing  research,  progressing  from  the  original  amyloid  theory  to  higher  levels including immunological and genetic theories. Increased knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms has helped researchers  identify  new  drug  targets,  and  the  rapid development  of  stem  cell  technology  has  made  it  possible  to  reveal  underlying mechanisms of AD pathology previously  unavailable.  For  example,  iPSC-derived  disease  models,  as  well  as  humanized  AD  animal  models,  have  great  potential  for  drug  development  and  AD screening.  Due  to  the  limitations  of  2D  and  3D  stem cell  model  protocols,  there  are  still  no  models  that  can fully  simulate  the  brains  of  fAD  patients.  Thus,  in  further research, aging and environmental factors should be included in iPSC-based models to explore whether phenotypes occur only in patient-specific cells.

To generate cell-cell circuits of different cell types, coculture  systems,  microfluidic  chips,  and  3D  organoids containing  neurons,  glial  cells,  and  immune  cells  with complex neuronal networks mimicking the brain should be developed. Researchers need to clarify the key principles of delaying aging to reverse AD through epigenetic remodeling.  Combined  with  multi-dimensional  phenotypic  analysis  and  single-cell  transcriptome  sequencing, the interactive effects of tissue injury, inflammation, and regeneration on the structure of the nervous system and systemic vasculature,  aging,  and  immune  challenge need to  be  systematically  studied.  A  systematic  view  of AD  needs  to  be  achieved  through  complex  data  modeling. AD organoid models constructed using gene editing tools to assess the association between risk genes and disease  phenotypes  require  further  research.  Although CRISPR  has  recently  been  useful  in  gene  treatment  of AD, its applications in humans are mainly limited to cancer research.

Notably, most existing attempts to treat AD with stem cells have used a single type of stem cell. Given the complexity  of  human  neural  networks,  stem  cell  transplantation  may  need  to  be  performed  in  conjunction  with small molecule drug induction. For example, in the case of neurogenesis, there is a reciprocal regulation between drug-induced regeneration and stem cell-induced regeneration, and the state of supporting cells in the environment  and  the  use  of  stem  cells  to  induce  glial  cells  for transplantation therapy also show considerable potential. Combined application of stem cells and glial cells is also a  promising direction. In the future, it seems likely that stem cell therapies will be combined with small molecule drugs (that promote neuroregeneration or regulate differentiation) or glial cell precursors. Such combination therapies can be studied accurately and efficiently using the above-described multi-level and multi-faceted models.

Many  recently  developed  omics  technologies  already have clinical applications. AD is a complex disease, and its pathogenesis is caused by protein alterations as well as DNA, mRNA, and even miRNA alterations. Research on the pathogenesis and treatment of AD is thus increasingly adopting a multi-omics approach. Take stem cell-derived exosomes  as  an  example.  The  exosomes  contain  proteins, mRNAs, miRNAs, and other substances, and their

contents  can  be  changed  in  a  targeted  manner  through exosome engineering, resulting in a therapeutic effect on AD  from  a  multi-omics  perspective.  Researchers  have identified  many  proteins  that  contribute  to  neuroprotection  in  MSC-derived  exosomes,  and  many  miRNAs that can be encapsulated in exosomes-such as miR-29a, miR-126-3p,  miR-137,  miR-144-3p,  miR-188-5p,  miR425-3p,  and  miR-451a-can have therapeutic effects  on AD. Such findings represent new advancement in multiomics research in the exploration of AD mechanisms and therapeutic approaches.

The  majority  of  drugs  and  therapies  for  AD  focus on  the  late  stage  of  AD  onset,  which  is  characterized by  memory  loss  and  aphasia  that  seriously  impact  the lives  of  AD  patients  and  their  families.  Medication  for advanced AD mainly aims to alleviate symptoms, reduce clinical progression, and delay disability. However, drugs with the potential to prevent AD are being tested using stem cell-derived disease models. Stem cell models make it  possible  to  demonstrate  the  entire  disease  process, reflecting effects of environmental factors and indicators of pathogenic risks. Regular physical examinations before clinical  symptoms appear and behavioral diagnosis may indicate AD development. Stem cells and their derivative therapies may also be able to intervene at the early stages of  AD  to  provide  a  real  cure  rather  than  just  alleviate symptoms and delay progression, providing a new way of thinking about treating AD and reducing the burden of this disease on the elderly and society.

The life  sciences  have  entered  the  era  of  big  data,  big platforms,  and  big  discoveries.  Big  data  technology  has greatly  enhanced  the  efficiency  of  research  and  biotechnology  for  the  treatment  of  AD.  Modern  software, machine learning, and comprehensive data analysis methods  can  aid  in  the  analysis  of  complex  biological processes involved in aging and disease and help evaluate the efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions and  cell  or  cell-derived  exosome  therapies.  Thus,  interdisciplinary collaborations between researchers from different fields are crucial.

Personalized medicine and precision medicine of biomarker development have also radically changed the conventional  paradigm  of  disease  diagnosis  and  treatment, resulting in transformation of the pharmaceutical industry in the field of AD. Stem cells and regenerative medicine  have  opened  up  new  paths  for  disease  treatment. Novel research methods, such as single-cell technology, directed proteomics technology, genome editing technology, and optogenetics technology, have enabled exploration of AD in a more precise and real-time manner.

In conclusion, stem cell technology has the potential to significantly advance the understanding and treatment of AD by providing new disease models, drug development opportunities,  and  cell  therapy  options.  In  the  future, stem  cell  technology  will  develop  in  the  direction  of informatization, manipulation, and multi-omics and play a positive role at different levels to achieve better therapeutic results for AD.
