Aim of the review: This study aimed to reveal the classical signal pathways and important potential targets of traditional  Chinese  medicine  (TCM)  for  treating  Alzheimer ' s  disease  (AD),  and  provide  support  for  further investigation on TCM and its active ingredients.

Materials and methods: Literature survey was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, CNKI, and other databases, with ' Alzheimer ' s  disease, '  ' traditional Chinese medicine, '  ' medicinal herb, '  ' Chinese herb, ' and ' natural plant ' as the primary keywords.

Results: TCM could modulate signal pathways related to AD pathological progression, including NFκ B, Nrf2, JAK/STAT, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, autophagy-lysosome pathway-related AMPK/mTOR, GSK-3/mTOR, and  PI3K/Akt/mTOR,  as  well  as  SIRT1  and  PPAR α pathway.  It  could  regulate  crosstalk  between  pathways through a multitarget, thus maintaining chronic inflammatory interaction balance, inhibiting oxidative stress damage, regulating ubiquitin-proteasome  system  function,  modulating  autophagy,  and  eventually  improving cognitive impairment in patients with AD.

Conclusion: TCM could be multilevel, multitargeted, and multifaceted to prevent and treat AD. In-depth research on the prevention and treatment of AD with TCM could provide new ideas for exploring the pathogenesis of AD and developing new anti-AD drugs.

people are predicted to be affected by 2030, with Alzheimer ' s disease (AD) accounting for 60 -70 % of dementia cases [1]. AD is the leading cause of disability in people over 65 years of age worldwide [2] and the fifth leading cause of death globally [3]. AD has become a global health

threat  to  older  adults.  It  is  a  heterogeneous  disease  with  complex pathobiology  [4].  It  is  characterized  clinically  by  progressive  loss  of memory  and  other  cognitive  functions  [5],  and  in  advanced  stages, patients may experience severe amnesic manifestations, hallucinations, disorientation,  and  ultimately  death  due  to  malnutrition,  dysphagia, aspiration pneumonia, and infection [6].

The onset of AD may be caused by a complex interplay of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors [5]. The core pathological features of AD are amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain,  with  associated  synaptic  and  neuronal  damage,  resulting  in cognitive deficits [7]. Amyloidβ (A β ) peptide and Tau protein are the main components of plaques and tangles, respectively [8]. A β peptides are  proteolytic  fragments  of  the  transmembrane  amyloid  precursor protein,  and substantial evidence supported a central role for pathological A β accumulation in the pathogenesis of AD [9]. A β is toxic to neurons in several  aspects,  leading  to  the  development  of  apoptosis, synaptic loss, and cytoskeletal disruption [10].

Tau  is  a  microtubule-associated  protein  in  the  brain.  Hyperphosphorylated  Tau  fibrillates  into  paired  helical  filaments  and  thus form NFTs in AD compared with healthy brains [11]. Many studies have shown  that  the  number  and  location  of  NFTs  are  closely  related  to neuronal  loss,  AD  disease  severity,  and  clinical  course  [12,13].  In addition,  growing  evidence  showed  that  A β and  Tau  interact.  For example,  abnormal  Tau  phosphorylation  increases  A β production  by trapping amyloid precursor protein (APP)-containing endosomes; meanwhile, A β oligomers drive Tau hyperphosphorylation, creating a vicious cycle that leads to the perpetuation of AD pathology [11].

No drugs are currently available to slow AD progression [3]. Marketed  cholinesterase  inhibitors  and  N-methyl  D-aspartate  antagonists provide only symptomatic relief, and their clinical importance remains controversial [14]. Considering the complex and multifactorial pathology of AD, TCM is safer than synthetic drugs with single-target activity, and it contains multiple active ingredients that could act on multiple targets simultaneously and exert a synergistic intervention in patients with AD [15]. For example, Polygonum multiflorum Thunb. (He Shou Wu) extract, Acrorus tatarinowii Schott (Shi Chang Pu) extract [16], Polygala tenuifolia Willd. (Yuan Zhi) extract [17], Coptis chinensis Franch (Huang Lian) extract [18], modified Huanglian-Jie-Du-Tang [19], and NeuroDefend [20] have been shown to improve AD pathological damage and alleviate  cognitive  deficits.  Clinical  trials  have  shown  that  TCM  has positive effects on early AD prevention and the improvement of cognition and brain activity in patients with AD [21]. Further exploration of the  regulatory  mechanisms  of  AD-related  signal  pathways  could  be beneficial to reveal the therapeutic targets of herbal interventions in AD. However, a systematic review of signal pathways in TCM interventions in AD research has not been conducted. Therefore, this study reviewed the research progress of the signal pathways of TCM and its effective active ingredients against AD in recent years to provide a reference for subsequent studies.

## 2. Signal pathways in TCM intervening pathological progression of AD

## 2.1. NFκ B signal pathway

Nuclear factorκ B (NFκ B) is a family of transcription factors that play  vital  roles  in  inflammation,  immunity,  cell  proliferation,  and apoptosis. In mammals, the NFκ B transcription factor family consists of five proteins: p65 (RelA), c-Rel, RelB, p105/p50, and p100/p52 [22]. All of the above members contain an N-terminal Rel homology domain and could form homodimers or heterodimers. In quiescent cells, these dimers bind to the inhibitor of NFκ B (I κ B) protein, and inactive transcription factors are sequestered in the cytoplasm. Upon  stimulation by pro-inflammatory  cytokines,  such  as  tumor  necrosis  factor  (TNF)α , interleukin (IL) GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 β , and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), I κ B protein is phosphorylated by the I κ B kinase complex, leading to ubiquitination and  degradation  of  I κ B  protein  and  thus  resulting  in  NFκ B  dimer translocating to the nucleus and driving transcription of target genes [23].  The  NFκ B  signal  pathway  is  considered  to  be  a  critical  signal pathway involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses [24]. It regulates  the  transcription  of  genes  such  as  cytokines,  chemokines, pro-inflammatory enzymes, pro-inflammatory transcription factors, and adhesion  molecules,  which  are  all  essential  for  regulating  neuroinflammation [25].

Growing evidence showed that neuroinflammation has an essential role  in  the  pathogenesis of  AD [1]. Astrocytes and microglia are the primary resident cells responsible for  the  immune/inflammatory response in the brain [26]. Misfolded and aggregated proteins in the brain could bind to microglia and astrocytes, triggering an innate immune response characterized by the release of inflammatory cytokines and ultimately leading to the development of chronic neuroinflammation  and  promoting  the  progression  of  AD  disease  [27]. Furthermore, NFκ B has binding sites in the promoter regions of genes involved in amyloidogenesis and inflammation, and long-term use of NSAIDs may prevent AD progression and delay its onset [28]. NFκ B is closely associated with the development of AD.

Baicalin (BAI) is a natural flavonoid isolated from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (Huang Qin), which is of interest for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in various neurological diseases [29]. After BAI intervention, the number of Iba-1-positive microglia in the brain of APP/PS1 double transgenic mice was reduced; the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin (IL) GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 β , and IL-18 were decreased; and the expression levels of nod-like receptor protein  3  (NLRP3),  TLR4,  p-NFκ B/p65,  and  p-I κ B α proteins  were reduced. These findings suggested that BAI could alleviate microglia-induced  neuroinflammation  in  the  brain  of  AD  mice  by inhibiting NLRP3 and TLR4/NFκ B signal pathways and promote the improvement of memory and cognitive deficits. Furthermore, in BV-2 microglia, BAI attenuated  LPS/A β -induced neuroinflammation by inhibiting NLRP3 and TLR4/NFκ B signal pathways [30].

Wang et al. [31] found that NaoXinTong (NXT) capsule alleviated spatial memory impairment and cognitive decline in APP/PS1 double transgenic mice; downregulated IL-1 β , IL-6, and TNFα ; inhibited NFκ B and TLR4 expression; and decreased A β and p-Tau levels. These findings suggested  that  NXT  may  delay  AD  progression  by  inhibiting  the TLR4/NFκ B/IL-1 β signal pathway, antagonizing the neuroinflammatory response, and delaying AD progression. The Chinese herb Sesamum  indicum L.  (Zhi  Ma)  is  rich  in  sesame  oil  (SO),  which  has pharmacological  effects  such  as  anti-inflammatory,  antioxidant,  and antitumor  [32].  Mohamed  et  al.  [33]  found  that  SO  significantly improved the learning and memory impairment induced by AlCl3  in mice,  decreased  acetylcholinesterase  (AChE)  and  A β levels,  downregulated TNFα and IL-1 β , decreased NFκ B and p38MAPK expression levels,  and  increased  BDNF  and  PPARγ expression.  These  findings suggested that SO attenuated neuroinflammation and oxidative stress damage and promoted cognitive recovery by regulating the NFκ B/p38MAPK/BDNF/PPARγ signal pathway.

Moreover, the herbal compounds Sanweidoukou decoction [34] and Qifu-Yin [35] and the natural herbal active ingredients tanshinone IIA [36], Forsythoside B [37], and Corydalis edulis total alkaloid [38] have shown  considerable  effects  in  promoting  cognitive  performance  and preventing AD by mechanisms related to the inhibition of the NFκ B signal pathway and the reduction of neuroinflammatory response.

In summary, chronic neuroinflammation is one of the core mechanisms of AD. The NFκ B signal pathway is a classical regulatory pathway of the inflammatory response. It could be targeted by TCM, and it is a pivotal target to slow down the progression of AD disease.

## 2.2. Nrf2 signal pathway

The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key transcription factor in antioxidant defense, and it intersects with many other

M.-R. Ding et al.

signaling  cascade  responses  [39].  Nrf2  belongs  to  the  Cap ' n ' Collar subfamily of the basic region-leucine zipper transcription factors and consists of seven conserved NRF2-ECH homology structural domains, each  with  a  different  function  [40].  Under  physiological  conditions, Kelchlike ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) inhibits Nrf2 activation by isolating  Nrf2  in  the  cytoplasm  and  targets  Nrf2  ubiquitination.  By contrast, under oxidative stress conditions, with the production of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), Nrf2 dissociates from Keap1 and translocates  to  the  nucleus,  where  it  binds  to  the  antioxidant  responsive element (ARE) to trigger transcription of downstream antioxidant enzymes, such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) [41].

Oxidative stress is known to play a vital role in developing AD [42]. Excessive  accumulation  of  ROS  associated  with  oxidative  stress  may promote  A β deposition  and  Tau  hyperphosphorylation  and  lead  to subsequent synaptic and neuronal loss, affecting synaptic activity and neurotransmission in neurons and leading to cognitive dysfunction [43]. Evidence showed that oxidative stress was manifested early in the course of AD [44], and decreased expression of Nrf2 [45] and its target genes NQO1 [46], HO-1 [47], GCLC, and glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier (GCLM) [48] were observed in the brains of patients with AD. Moreover, ongoing  evidence  highlighted  the  protective  role  of  the  Nrf2  signal pathway in AD. Activation of Nrf2 upregulated the expression of antioxidant  enzymes  and  various  proteins  that  reduce  oxidative  stress damage and neuroinflammation, thereby delaying the progression of AD [49].

Various Chinese herbs have been shown to activate the Nrf2 signal pathway.  For  example,  Rhynchophylline  (Rhy)  is  the  main  active component of the medicinal herb Uncaria rhynchophylla (Miq.) Jacks. (Gou  Teng),  which  has  been  shown  in  many  studies  to  ameliorate cognitive deficits in animal AD models [50]. Jiang et al. [51] used Rhy to intervene in an A β 1 -42-induced mouse model of AD and found that the treated mice showed improved cognitive function; reduced brain ROS and  MDA  levels;  increased  GSH  levels;  and  significantly  increased expression  of  Nrf2  and  its  downstream  proteins  HO-1,  NOQ1,  and GCLM.  Rhy  could  exert  antioxidative  stress  effects  and  attenuate A β 1 -42-induced neurotoxicity through activating the Nrf2/ARE signal pathway, with positive therapeutic effects in AD mice.

Qin et al. [52] found that Astragalus polysaccharide increased the expression of Nrf2 in the nucleus and the expression of SOD and GSH-Px, and  reduced  the  accumulation  of  MDA,  thereby  reducing  oxidative stress damage and significantly improving the spatial learning memory ability of APP/PS1 mice. Bian et al. [53] reported that oxyphylla A, an extract of Alpinia oxyphylla Miq. (Yi Zhi), contributed to the improvement of  cognitive  function  in  senescence-accelerated  mouse  prone  8 mice by reducing the expression of APP, A β 1 -40, and A β 1 -42 in the brain. The antioxidant mechanism was associated with increased expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes HO-1 and NQO1 in the brain and the inhibition of the expression of Nrf2 regulatory protein Keap1.

Various herbal active ingredients could slow down the progression of AD.  For  example, Centella  asiatica (L.)  Urb.  (Ji  Xue  Cao)  improved cognitive performance and reduced A β deposition in the brain of 5 × Familial Alzheimer ' s disease (5XFAD) mice; it acted by increasing the expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes HO-1, NQO1, and GCLC [54,55].  Hydroxyα -sanshool,  the  active  ingredient  of Zanthoxylum schinifolium Sieb.  et  Zucc.  (Hua  Jiao),  exerted  antioxidant  stress  and neuroprotective  effects  through  activation  of  the  Nrf2/HO-1  signal pathway, thus improving the cognitive function of D-gal/AlCl3-induced AD-like mice [56].

In  conclusion,  oxidative  stress  is  one  of  the  core  pathological mechanisms in AD, and the Nrf2 signal pathway plays a significant role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis [57]. Many herbal medicines and their active ingredients could target the activation of Nrf2, thereby reducing  oxidative  stress  damage  and  providing  neuronal  protection against the progression of AD. They are potential therapeutic agents for alleviating AD pathology.

## 2.3. Nrf2 and NFκ B signal pathway interplay in AD

Recent studies have found that interacting oxidative disorders and neuroinflammation underlie the pathological mechanisms of AD [58]. Oxidative stress results from the excessive release of ROS in the brain [59]. ROS can induce glial cell activation, stimulate the expression of inflammatory  cytokines,  and  trigger  chronic  neuroinflammation.  In turn, continuously activated microglia and astrocytes can produce large amounts of ROS, thus promoting oxidative stress [60]. Oxidative stress and deleterious inflammation form a vicious cycle that synergistically promotes AD development [61]. This cycle involves stimulating transcription factors, such as NFκ B and Nrf2, that are sensitive to oxidative stress and inflammation.

NFκ B is the main transcription factor that controls the expression of pro-inflammatory  genes  in  microglia  [62].  Nrf2  is  a  redox-sensitive transcription factor located in the cytoplasm that helps cells adapt to oxidative stress and chronic inflammation by upregulating the expression of protective genes [63]. The Nrf2 and NFκ B signal pathways are vital pathways that synergistically regulate the balance between cellular redox  status  and  inflammatory  responses  [49].  The  current  study showed that downregulation of Nrf2 could increase in NFκ B activity and promote the expression of inflammatory markers. Nrf2 interacts with  NFκ B  to  coordinate  antioxidant  stress  and  inflammatory  responses,  and  it  may  be  a  promising  target  against  AD  pathological progression.

Recent studies have continued to point out that in addition to being a central  regulator  of  the  antioxidant  stress  response,  the  Nrf2  signal pathway plays an essential role in suppressing inflammation. The Nrf2 signal pathway is often accompanied by inhibition of the NFκ B signal pathway and diminished inflammatory response [64 -66]. Reduction in intracellular ROS to inhibit oxidative stress-mediated NFκ B activation, upregulation of HO-1 expression to prevent I κ Bα proteasomal degradation, and inhibition of NFκ B nuclear translocation were also found [67]. Common Nrf2 agonists, including sulforaphane [68], astaxanthin [69],  curcumin  [70],  and  epigallocatechin-3-gallate  [71],  have  been found  to  exert  anti-inflammatory  properties  by  inhibiting  the  NFκ B signal pathway.

In addition to inflammatory damage, NFκ B is involved in regulating oxidative stress response. NFκ B could regulate the transcription and activity of Nrf2, with positive or negative effects on the expression of its target genes [72]. NFκ B could regulate the expression of various antioxidant  proteases,  including  manganese  superoxide  dismutase  [73], glutathione transferase [74], and HO-1 [75]. The NFκ B/p65 subunit could inhibit the Nrf2/ARE signal pathway by depriving CREB binding protein from Nrf2 [76], and Nrf2 target genes, such as NQO1, GCLC, and GCLM, have NFκ B binding sites [67].

Growing evidence showed that TCM and its active ingredients have positive effects on the complex interaction mechanisms between Nrf2 and NFκ B signal pathways, and this may be an essential strategy to combat AD. As the main active ingredient of Citrus  reticulata Blanco (Chen Pi) [77], Hesperidin (HP) is a common neuroprotective agent that has received much  attention for its significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory  properties  in  neurodegenerative  diseases  [78].  HP treatment  significantly  ameliorated  cognitive  function  in  APP/PS1 double transgenic mice; increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px in the brain; increased Nrf2 and HO-1 expression; decreased inflammatory cytokines TNFα , C-reactive protein, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels; and inhibited p-I κ B α protein  expression  and  NFκ B/p65 nuclear  translocation.  These  findings suggested  that  HP  could  inhibit  oxidative  stress  injury  and  neuroinflammation in the brain of AD mice by upregulating Nrf2 expression and  inhibiting  NFκ B  signal  pathway,  ultimately  promoting  their cognitive function [79].

Lei  et  al.  [80]  investigated  the  therapeutic  effects  of  pinoresinol

M.-R. Ding et al.

diglucoside  (PDG),  the  main  active  ingredient  of Eucommia  ulmoides Oliv.  (Du  Zhong),  on  cognitive  impairment  in  an  A β 1 -42-induced AD mouse model. PDG was found to significantly improve cognitive performance, reduce the levels of ROS and MDA, increase the release of SOD and CAT in the brain, and increase the protein expression of Nrf2 and  HO-1  in  the  hippocampus  of  AD  mice.  PDG  also  decreased  the release  levels  of  IL-1 β and  TNFα and  downregulated  the  protein expression of NFκ B/p65. Furthermore, the Bcl-2/Bax ratio was upregulated  in  the  brains  of  PDG-treated  mice,  the  protein  expression  of cytochrome C and cleaved caspase-3 was reduced, and A β 1 -42-induced neuronal apoptosis was inhibited. These findings indicated that PDG could  effectively  regulate  oxidative  stress  state,  inflammation,  and neuronal apoptosis by activating the Nrf2/NFκ B transcriptional pathway,  thus  reducing  neuronal  damage  and  improving  cognitive dysfunction, which has a certain therapeutic effect on AD mice.

In-vitro data showed that isoliquiritigenin, the active ingredient of the  Chinese  herb Glycyrrhiza  uralensis Fisch.  (Gan  Cao),  reduced  the production  of  inflammatory  cytokines  iNOS,  COX-2,  IL-1 β ,  IL-6,  and TNFα by upregulating the expression of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 and inhibiting NFκ B activation [81]. This study suggested that activating Nrf2 antagonizes NFκ B activity and thus exerts anti-inflammatory effects. Besides, the active ingredients of TCM, such as platycodin D [82], higenamine  [83], α -cyperone  [84],  sulforaphane  [85],  and  lycopene [86], exhibited certain neuroprotective activities. The mechanisms were related  to  anti-inflammatory  and  antioxidant  properties  through  the regulation of the Nrf2/NFκ B signal pathway.

To sum up, the onset and development of AD is a complex process caused, in large part, by crosstalk between oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.  NFκ B and Nrf2 signal pathway-mediated  chronic inflammation and oxidative stress contribute to AD development. The synergy between Nrf2 and NFκ B signal pathways is an important entry point for delaying the pathological progression of AD. TCM has multitarget and bi-directional regulation, and the multi-faceted coordination of  NFκ B  and  Nrf2  may  reduce  oxidative  stress,  pathological  neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis in the brains of patients with AD, thus slowing down the progression of AD disease, which is a potential target for the prevention and treatment of AD.

## 2.4. JAK/STAT signal pathway

The Janus kinase/signal transducer  and activator of  transcription (JAK/STAT)  signal  pathway  is  central to extracellular cytokineactivated receptor-mediated signal transduction. In mammals, the JAK family has four members: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2, and the STAT family  includes  seven  members:  STAT1,  STAT2,  STAT3,  STAT4, STAT5a, STAT5b, and STAT6 [87]. The JAK/STAT signal pathway is involved in regulating several CNS functions, including neurogenesis, gliogenesis,  synaptic  plasticity,  and  microglia  activation.  Aberrant activation  or  phosphorylation  of  its  pathway  components  is  closely associated  with  many  neurodegenerative  diseases,  such  as  AD  [88]. IFNγ and IL-6 are the most potent activators of the JAK/STAT signal pathway  [89].  Interestingly,  both  of  these  cytokines  have  also  been found to be overexpressed in patients with AD [90,91]. Activation of JAK leads to the phosphorylation and dimerization of STATs, which are then transferred from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where they bind to specific DNA elements to regulate the transcription of cytokine-related genes [92]. A growing number of studies have shown that the JAK/STAT signal pathway plays an essential role in AD development [93].

Suan-Zao-Ren decoction (SZRD) is widely used to treat neurological disorders, including dementia, depression, and insomnia, with potential benefits  for  AD  treatment.  Long  et  al.  [94]  observed  changes  in  the expression of the JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway in an AD mouse model and the effect of SZRD on this pathway. They showed that SZRD intervention significantly reduced cognitive impairment; decreased A β plaque deposition and neuronal loss; improved synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus; decreased p-JAK2-Tyr1007 and p-STAT3-Tyr705 protein expression; and inhibited inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1 β , and TNFα in APP/PS1 mice. These findings suggested that SZRD may be able to improve cognitive deficits in AD mice by downregulating the JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway to reduce A β deposition and neuroinflammation.

Cornel iridoid glycoside (CIG) is a terpenoid extracted from Cornus officinalis Sieb.et Zucc. (Shan Zhu Yu) [95], with neuroprotective effects [96,97]. Ma et al. [98] found that CIG reduced the protein expression of p-JAK2, p-STAT1, and STAT1 and increased the expression levels of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B  and α -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole  propionic  acid receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluA1 in the brain of P301S transgenic mice. This finding suggested that CIG could alleviate STAT1-induced inhibition  of  NMDAR  expression  by  inhibiting  the  JAK2/STAT1  signal pathway, thereby increasing synaptic ultrastructure and number in the brain, improving synaptic plasticity, and ultimately effectively improving cognitive function in AD mice.

In  addition,  many  herbal  medicines  and  their  active  ingredients could delay the progression of AD pathology. For instance, ganoderic acid A significantly improved cognitive deficits in d-gal-treated mice by inhibiting the Th17 cell-induced JAK/STAT signal pathway and regulating Treg cells to enhance mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, thus  improving  brain  mitochondrial  dysfunction  and  reduce  neuroinflammation [99]. Curcumin, a natural polyphenolic compound [100], has  been  proven  to  have  a  potential  therapeutic  effect  in  inhibiting neuroinflammation  by  a  mechanism  related  to  the  regulation  of  the JAK/STAT/SOCS signal pathway [101].

## 2.5. Protein degradation systems

Pathogenic accumulation of proteins such as A β and Tau could lead to progressive neuronal loss and cognitive deficits, thus contributing to AD  development  [102].  The  protein  degradation  pathway  has  been recognized  as  an  important  approach  to  combat  AD.  Because  of  its ability to degrade misfolded and easily aggregated abnormal proteins, this  pathway plays an important role in maintaining normal cellular metabolism  and  avoiding  protein  dysfunction.  The  main  pathways include the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) and the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP) [103].

## 2.5.1. Ubiquitin-proteasome pathway

In eukaryotes, the vast majority of protein degradation takes place via UPP. UPP relies on ubiquitin (Ub) signals to target proteins to the proteasome  and  to  achieve  ubiquitination  and  degradation  of  target proteins in a highly coordinated manner [104]. Ubiquitination is tightly controlled by the enzymatic cascade reaction. The cascade reaction is initiated by Ub activation catalyzed by the Ub-activating enzyme (E1), followed by the formation of a high-energy thioester bond between the E1 enzyme and activated Ub, thus transferring Ub to the Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2). Next the Ub-ligase enzyme (E3) binds the E2 enzyme to the target protein and transfers Ub to the substrate, where the E3 enzyme determines  the  substrate  specificity  of  the  protein.  Finally,  the  26  S proteasome recognizes the target protein and undergoes degradation [105].

Due to the critical role of UPP in maintaining protein homeostasis, dysregulation of UPP is receiving sustained attention as an important factor in the pathogenesis of AD which is characterized by massive aggregation of harmful proteins [106]. Significant decreases in proteasome activity have been reported to be observed in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, superior temporal gyri, middle temporal gyri, and inferior parietal lobule in patients with AD compared to controls, indicating impaired proteasome function in AD [107]. The ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated receptor degradation in APP mutant transgenic mice were found to be affected to some extent, and the proteasome and deubiquitinating enzyme activities were also inhibited [108]. In addition, continued evidence suggests that abnormal ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) activity may lead to dysregulated

M.-R. Ding et al.

degradation of A β and Tau proteins. For example, in the triple transgenic (3xTg)-AD mouse model, blocking UPP by application of proteasome-specific inhibitors was found to result in a significant increase in the accumulation of A β and Tau proteins, while enhancing UPP specifically induced Tau protein degradation and reduced abnormal Tau protein levels in the brains of AD mice [109,110]. Another study pointed out that UPP is involved in the formation of abnormal aggregation of phosphorylated Tau proteins through stress granules, and it highlights the importance of activating UPP for alleviating AD pathology [111]. Therefore, the close association between UPP and the pathogenesis of AD  may  open  new  avenues  for  exploring  therapeutic  strategies  for UPP-based treatment of AD in Chinese herbs, and numerous studies have been reported to support this view.

Iyaswamy et al. [112] found that Yuan-Hu Zhi Tong Prescription (YZT)  significantly  improved  learning,  memory  function  and  motor deficits  in  P301S  Tau  and  3xTg-AD  mice;  reduced  the  load  of  phosphorylated  Tau  protein  in  the  brain;  and  decreased  ploy  Ub  protein levels. These findings suggested that YZT may exert anti-AD activity by modulating UPP to promote degradation of insoluble Tau aggregates. Sreenivasmurthy et al. [113] investigated the neuroprotective effects of protopine (PRO), a component of Corydalis yanhusuo W.T. Wang (Yan Hu Suo), on P301S Tau and 3xTg-AD mouse models. PRO was found to significantly improve learning and memory abilities; attenuate Tau pathology; inhibit histone deacetylase 6 activity; and enhance the molecular  chaperones  heat  shock  protein  70  (HSP70),  HSP90,  heat  shock cognate 70 (HSC70), and acetylated HSP90 protein expression.

In addition, Li et al. [114] found that Yuan-zhi-san (YZS) improved memory deficits, restored neuronal numbers, reversed ultrastructural abnormalities and increased dendritic spine density in A β 1 -40-induced AD rat model. The expression levels of UbE1a/b, UbE2a, carboxyl terminus of HSC70-interacting protein, ubiquitin C-236 terminal hydrolase L1, and 26 S proteasome proteins were significantly increased and the hyperphosphorylation of Tau proteins (Ser199 and Thr231) was effectively  inhibited  in  AD rat  brain  after  YZS  intervention.  These  results suggested  that  YZS  could  restore  UPP  function  in  AD  rats,  thus  promoting the degradation of phosphorylated Tau proteins and the recovery of normal neurological function and memory enhancement.

## 2.5.2. Autophagy -lysosome pathway

Although UPS has been recognized for decades as a key regulator of degradation  of  various  aggregation-prone  proteins,  ALP  has  recently been shown to be an important pathway associated with neuronal health and related diseases [115]. This pathway is specifically responsible for the delivery and digestion of cellular contents, misfolded proteins, and damaged organelles produced during cellular catabolism, thus playing a protective role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, energy balance, and cellular defense [116].

In mammalian cells, autophagy could be classified into three main subtypes based on differences in target substrate recognition and delivery to lysosome: macroautophagy, microautophagy and chaperonemediated  autophagy  (CMA)  [117].  Among  them,  macroautophagy (hereinafter  referred  to  as ' autophagy ' )  represents  the  majority  of autophagic processes and is the main pathway for removing A β and abnormal Tau proteins [118]. Autophagy is a multistep process. Cytoplasmic cargoes are initially isolated by a phagophore that elongates to form  the  double-membrane  structured  vesicle  called  autophagosome [119]. During this phase, the Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase (ULK)  complex  promotes  phagophore  initiation  and  elongation  by recruiting and activating lipid kinase complexes [120]. This complex catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, allowing further recruitment of specific autophagy proteins necessary for phagophore formation and constituting the active complex autophagy-related gene (ATG) 5-ATG12-ATG12L1. These activities together lead to the binding of microtubule-associated proteins 1 A/1B Light Chain 3B (LC3) and Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein family members to phosphatidylethanolamine, resulting in the formation of LC3-II, a major marker of autophagy, which also leads to the formation of autophagosome by the extension and closure of  phagophore membrane [121]. Finally,  the  outer  membrane  of  the  autophagosome  fuses  with  the lysosomal membrane to form an autolysosome, allowing lysosomal hydrolases to degrade autophagic cargoes and release the recovered nutrients back into the cytoplasm for reuse [117].

In contrast to non-neuronal cells, neuronal cells are highly dependent on autophagy for their survival [122]. This is because neurons are post mitotic cells and are unable to dilute damaged organelles and abnormal proteins through mitosis. Thus neurons are in urgent need of efficient degradation of abnormal proteins such as A β and phosphorylated Tau proteins through the autophagic pathway [123]. Once the ALP pathway is defective and leads to a progressive accumulation of cellular waste, it will place a heavy burden on neurons [124]. Growing evidence showed that ALP dysfunction may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD. Impaired lysosomal protein degradation and excessive accumulation of autophagic vesicles were found in the brains of patients with AD and animal models of AD compared to normal brains [125,126127]; more severe  memory impairment as well as more A β aggregation and SPs formation in the brain were seen in the offspring of autophagy-deficient mice [128].

ALP has a dual role in AD pathogenesis [129]. In the early stage of AD, autophagy gene expression is heavily upregulated, delivering misfolded proteins (including A β and Tau proteins) from neurons to lysosomes  for  efficient  degradation,  exerting  an  initial  neuroprotective response  [130].  However,  it  has  been  reported  that  the  lysosomal degradation function has started to be significantly  impaired  by this time,  with  a  progressive  decrease  in  substrate  lysosomal  clearance [131]. As AD progresses, excessive autophagic activation beyond the lysosomal clearance capacity could lead to a massive accumulation of immature autophagosomes in neurons and impaired autophagosome-lysosome fusion, resulting in excessive organelle degradation, self-digestion, and neuronal death, thus accelerating AD pathology [130].

In the past decades, great progress has been made in the search for autophagy-lysosome modulators from TCM, providing new insights into the development of therapeutic strategies for AD targeting ALP. Tanscription  factor  EB  (TFEB)  is  a  key  transcription  factor  that  controls autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis [132]. Yang et al. [133] found that celastrol (Cel), a component of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f. (Lei Gong Teng),  could  improve  memory  impairment  and  cognitive  deficits  in P301S Tau and 3xTg-AD mice; reduce the aggregation of phosphorylated Tau protein in the brain; promote TFEB nuclear translocation; and increase the production of autophagy marker LC3B-II and decrease the expression  of  SQSTM1/p62.  These  findings  suggested  that  Cel  may promote the degradation of phosphorylated Tau proteins and enhance the  cognitive  performance  of  AD  mice  by  activating  TFEB-mediated autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis.

Furthermore,  in  vitro  experiments  also  confirmed  that  Chinese medicine and its main active ingredients and derivatives, such as panax notoginseng saponins [134], β -asarone [135], and corynoxine B derivative CB6 [136], have certain autophagy-inducing and neuroprotective effects.

2.5.2.1. mTOR-dependent pathway. Autophagic signals can be regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal pathway [137]. mTOR is a 289 kDa serine/threonine protein kinase in the PI3K-related protein kinase family [138]. It is present in mammals as two types of protein complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) [139]. Among them, mTORC1 is the main controller of ALP that inhibits autophagosomes formation and could regulate autophagy by modulating the activity of the ULK1 complex [140,141]. Besides, mTORC1  inhibition  could  lead  to  dephosphorylation  of  TFEB  and translocation of TFEB to the nucleus, where it binds to the promoter

region  containing  the  CLEAR  (coordinated  lysosomal  expression  and regulation) sequence, thus upregulating the expression of lysosomal and autophagy-related  genes  and  promoting  lysosomal  biogenesis  and autophagy  induction  [142].  In  contrast,  mTORC2  is  insensitive  to rapamycin and has been found to regulate CMA activity in recent years [143].  Numerous  studies  have  shown  that  upregulation  of  multiple components of the mTOR signal pathway and its association with Tau pathology could be observed in the brains of patients with AD [144, 145146].

Recent studies have shown that mTOR could coordinate or interact with  various  upstream  signals,  such  as  adenosine  monophosphateactivated protein kinase (AMPK), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) [147].

AMPK is a heterotrimeric complex consisting of α -catalytic subunit, β -regulatory subunit, and γ -regulatory subunit [148]. AMPK is a major regulator of cellular energy metabolism and could act as a pivotal sensor of  relative  energy  status  in  the  cell  upstream  of  mTOR,  activating autophagy during low energy states with high AMP/ATP ratio [149]. Activated  AMPK  has  been  found  to  inhibit  mTOR  activity  by  phosphorylating and activating tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) function.  TSC2  is  a  GTPase-activating  protein  that  inhibits  mTORC1  by converting the RAS homologue enriched in brain (RHEB) GTPase from the  active  GTP-bound  form  to  the  inactive  GDP-bound  form  [150]. Additionally,  activated  AMPK  could  downregulate  mTOR  signal  by directly phosphorylating regulatory-associated protein of  mTOR (Raptor) [151] or directly phosphorylate ULK1, a downstream target of mTORC1,  to  enhance  autophagy  [152,153],  thereby  increasing  A β clearance, alleviating Tau pathology, and improving cognitive function. However, some studies noted that AMPK activation had non-neuroprotective properties that might lead to deleterious outcomes such as A β production and abnormal phosphorylation of Tau proteins [154].

As a regulator of a wide variety of cellular processes, GSK-3 is central to cellular metabolism and signaling processes [155]. And it is considered to be a critical regulator involved in a number of neuronal processes including axonal transport, cholinergic function, and synaptic plasticity [156]. Moreover, GSK-3, one of the negative regulators of mTORC1, could  regulate  autophagy  and  lysosomal  activity  by  phosphorylating TSC2 or directly phosphorylating Raptor at Ser859 to inhibit mTORC1 [155]. GSK-3 hyperactivity has been observed in the brains of patients with AD [157,158], and overexpression of GSK-3 has been shown to induce  AD  pathology,  cognitive  deficits,  and  gliosis  in  many  animal models of AD [159,160161162163].

The PI3K/AKT signal pathway has significant roles in the brain in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration as well as establishing neuronal polarity, regulating neurotransmission and enhancing synaptic plasticity [164]. PI3K could convert phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidyl-inositol, 3,4,5  triphosphate  by  being  activated  by  the  input  signal,  which  in turn leads to AKT activation. Activated AKT could prevent its negative regulation of Rheb  by phosphorylating TSC1/2, thus activating mTORC1 [165]. The  abnormal  and  sustained  activation  of  neuronal PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal transduction has been reported to be an early feature of AD [166]. However, another study pointed out that while inhibition of PI3K/mTOR signal pathway activated autophagy to eliminate  toxic  proteins,  activation  of  PI3K  could  promote  neuronal  cell survival [151].

Increasing  evidence  suggests  the  importance  of  mTOR-dependent autophagy in the pathogenesis of AD [167]. In-depth understanding of mTOR and its upstream signals may provide new ideas to explore the potential targets of TCM for the treatment of AD [168]. Rahman et al. [169]  found  that  oxyresveratrol  (OxyR)  reduced  the  production  of glucocorticoid-induced APP in mouse cortical astrocytes; increased the number of LC-3 puncta formation and LC3-II protein expression levels; increased  the  expression  of  p-AMPK,  p-ULK1  (Ser757),  and  p-ULK1 (Ser555) proteins; and suppressed the expression of mTOR downstream phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (Ser240/244). These findings suggested that OxyR could activate autophagy by regulating the AMPK/ULK1/mTOR signal pathway, thereby reducing APP production in mouse cortical astrocytes and exerting anti-neurotoxic effects.

P . tenuifolia Willd.  (Yuan  Zhi)  has  been  widely  used  in  clinical treatment  of  insomnia,  cognitive  decline,  and  neurasthenia  [170]. Studies have shown that it may induce autophagy through upregulation of AMPK/mTOR signal pathway, thus inhibiting the aggregation of A β and acting anti-AD effects [171]. Huang et al. [172] explored the neuroprotective  effects  of  galangin  (GA)  on  okadaic  acid  (OA)-induced PC12 cell injury. The results showed that GA treatment significantly increased OA-induced PC12 cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner; decreased the levels of p-Tau, A β 42, and β -secretase; increased the expression of p-Akt and p-mTOR; and attenuated the expression of p-GSK3 β and Beclin-1.  These  findings  suggested  that  GA  could  exert certain  neuroprotective  effects  by  regulating  the  Akt/GSK3 β /mTOR-dependent autophagic pathway.

Curcumin (CUR) is the main polyphenol contained in Curcuma longa L.(Jiang Huang) [173]. Wang et al. [174] found that CUR could induce autophagy  through  downregulation  of  the  PI3K/Akt/mTOR  signal pathway, thus reducing the production of A β and improving cognitive impairment. Such effects correspond to the manifestations of excessive activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal pathway and reduced autophagy observed  in  the  brains  of  patients  with  advanced  AD  [175].  These findings suggested that Chinese herbs and their active ingredients may exert anti-AD effects by inducing autophagy to protect neurons.

Interestingly, other studies have indicated that upregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR  signal  pathway  could  show  neuroprotective  effects under  certain  circumstances.  For  example,  Deng  et  al.  [176]  used β -asarone, the active ingredient of Acorus tatarinowii Schott (Shi Chang Pu), to intervene in APP/PS1 mice and found that compared with the untreated  group,  the  treated  group  showed  increased  expression  of p-mTOR and p62 and decreased expression of p-Akt, Beclin-1, and LC3B. In  addition,  their  learning  and  memory  ability  was  significantly improved, suggesting that β -asarone could improve the cognitive ability of  AD  mice  by  upregulating  the  PI3K/Akt/mTOR  signal  pathway  to inhibit Beclin-1-dependent autophagy. In-vitro studies have also demonstrated  that β -asarone  attenuated  A β 1 -42-induced  neuronal toxicity  by  activating  the  Akt/mTOR  signal  pathway  to  attenuate autophagy [177].

The above studies suggested that the potential pathways regulating mTOR-dependent  autophagy  are  intricate  and  complex.  Therefore, clinical treatment of AD should pay due attention to the central role of the mTOR signal pathway in ALP regulation, while dynamically coordinating the balance between mTOR and its upstream signals. Compared with simple mTOR inhibitors or agonists, the advantage of TCM is that it can  play  a  synergistic  role  between  drugs,  or  can  play  a  role  in dynamically  regulating  mTOR  and  its  related  signal  pathways  and autophagic activity, which is more in line with the rule of AD pathological transformation.

2.5.2.2. mTOR-independent signal  pathway. Although current research on autophagy-related signal pathways has been mainly focused on the classical mTOR signal pathway, autophagy could also be regulated by other mTOR-independent signal pathways, such as the silent information-regulated transcription factor 1 (SIRT1) signal pathway and the  peroxisome proliferator activated receptor  alpha  (PPARα )  signal pathway [178].

SIRT1,  a  nicotinamide  adenosine  dinucleotide-dependent  class-III protein deacetylase, is widely expressed in the brain and is involved in regulating important processes such as neurogenesis, neuroprotection, synaptic plasticity, and memory formation [179]. SIRT1 expression has been reported to be significantly downregulated in the brains of patients with AD [180]. In vivo experiments showed that inhibition or knockdown of SIRT1 exacerbated synaptic loss and impaired the ability of

learning and memory in AD mice [181,182]. In contrast, overexpression of SIRT1 reduced A β aggregation, promoted Tau protein deacetylation and improved Tau pathological propagation, thus improving cognitive function and reducing mortality [183,184]. In addition, SIRT1 has an important role in autophagy regulation and could activate autophagy through deacetylation of some Atg proteins [185]. From these, it is clear that SIRT1 is closely related to autophagy regulation  and  AD progression.

PPAR α ,  PPAR δ ,  and  PPAR γ are transcription factors that regulate gene expression upon ligand activation [186]. Among them, PPAR α is responsible for  the  regulation of  cellular  metabolism  and  energy  homeostasis [187], including the fatty acid β -oxidation pathway, glucose metabolism,  and  glutamatergic  and  cholinergic/dopaminergic  neurotransmission in the brain [188]. Cumulative evidence suggested strong association between PPAR α and AD. For instance, PPAR α -null mice were found to have deficits in spatial learning and memory abilities [189]. Moreover,  activation  of  PPAR α -mediated  autophagy  and  lysosomal pathway  could  inhibit  the  accumulation  of  A β in  hippocampal  and cortical tissues of APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice and ameliorate their spatial learning deficits, memory deficits, and anxiety symptoms [190], suggesting that PPAR α is required for the maintenance of normal cognitive performance [191]. In addition, it has been reported that PPAR α could induce the expression of ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10) in the brain of flag-TFEB transgenic mice in an autophagy-dependent manner  and  stimulate  APP  processing  toward  the  alpha-secretase pathway, thus increasing soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha production  and  reducing  c-terminal  fragmentβ (CTFβ )  level,  thereby exerting definite neuroprotective effects [192].

Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural phenolic compound widely found in Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et Zucc. (Hu Zhang), Morus alba L. (Sang Bai Pi), Magnolia officinalis Rehd. Et Wils. (Hou Po), and other Chinese herbs [193].  Recent  studies  have  identified  RSV  as  a  natural  autophagy modulator against AD [194], which could inhibit inflammatory cytokine release,  modulate  mitochondrial  function,  reduce  A β deposition,  and improve impaired cognitive performance [195 -197]. RSV was found to inhibit the A β 25 -35-induced decrease in viability of PC12 cells; upregulate  LC3-II  expression;  promote  autophagosome  formation  and  p62

degradation; and increase the expression of SIRT1, auto-poly-ADP-ribosylation of poly polymerase 1 (PARP1), and tyrosyl transfer-RNA  synthetase  (TyrRS)  proteins  [198].  These  findings  suggested  that  RSV  may  induce  autophagy  through  activation  of  the TyrRS-PARP1-SIRT1 signal pathway, thus attenuating A β 25 -35-induced neurotoxicity. Furthermore, Yang et al. [199] found that fisetin could attenuate Pb-induced synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment by regulating AMPK/SIRT1 signal pathway and autophagy pathway.

Iyaswamy et al. [200] found that Cynanchum otophyllum Schneid. (Qing Yang Shen, QYS) could significantly improve spatial memory and learning ability in 3xTg-AD mice; reduce the accumulation of insoluble A β aggregates and phosphorylated Tau aggregates; downregulate the expression of APP, CTF, p-APP, p-CTF, and Sarcosyl-insoluble fractions of phosphorylated Tau proteins (PHF1, CP13, MC1, AT8, and HT7); and increase expression levels of PPAR α , TFEB, LC3B-II, LAMP1, and mature CTSD. These findings suggested that QYS could promote ALP through activation of the PPAR α -TFEB signal pathway, thus alleviating AD pathology and promoting recovery of cognitive function. In addition, in 5XFAD mice, cinnamic acid also could activate PPAR α ,  upregulate TFEB, and increase lysosome biosynthesis, thus inhibiting the production of SPs and improving memory function in AD mice [201].

## 3. Conclusion

Intracellular signal pathways mediate significant events in cellular life  cycle,  and  they  are  closely  associated  with  AD  development. Simultaneously, during the evolution of organisms, complex and close connections  have  been  established  between  major  signal  pathways [202]. In the present study, the action mechanisms and potentials of TCM against AD were synthesized and summarized from the perspective of signal pathways (Tables 1 and 2). Chinese herbs could regulate signal pathways related to AD pathological progression, such as NFκ B, Nrf2, JAK/STAT, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, autophagy-lysosome pathway-related AMPK/mTOR, GSK-3/mTOR, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR, as well as SIRT1 and PPAR α pathway. They could regulate crosstalk between pathways  through  multitarget  synergy,  thus  maintaining  chronic  inflammatory  interaction  balance,  inhibiting  oxidative  stress  damage,

Fig. 1. Potential targets of TCM for treating AD. TCM could regulate signal pathways related to AD pathological progression, including NFκ B, Nrf2, JAK/STAT, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, autophagy-lysosome pathway-related AMPK/mTOR, GSK-3/mTOR, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR, as well as SIRT1 and PPAR α pathway. These signal pathways involved in A β deposition, Tau protein hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, protein degradation and autophagy. TCM are therefore alleviating the AD progression and improving cognitive impairment. This figure was created with BioRender (https://biorender.com/).

regulating  ubiquitin-proteasome  system  function,  modulating  autophagy, and ultimately improving cognitive impairment in patients with AD (Fig. 1). Considering the complexity of AD pathological mechanisms, TCM with multilevel and multitarget potential may become a breakthrough  for  AD  therapeutic  drug  development.  The  prospects  for exploring and developing potential novel anti-AD drugs from TCM and its active ingredients are broad. Besides, signal pathways such as HIPPO [203] and Notch [204] are closely related to delaying AD development. However, relatively few studies have reported on the prevention and treatment of AD through these pathways, and this could be one of the directions  to  be  further  explored  in  the  future.  To  sum  up,  future research  on  the  prevention  and  treatment  of  AD  in  TCM  should  be carried out in depth to provide new ideas for exploring the pathogenesis of AD and screening potential targets for the treatment of AD, and to lay a certain foundation for further development of novel AD therapeutic drugs.
